Like they were suspect from the get go, I remember their finance guy would call me and stuff. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:06\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:07\\n\\nAnd I Googled him, he looks like he's the owner's son. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:12\\n\\nOh, I see.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:12\\n\\nBut he's like a production manager or something. So I don't know why he's the one that makes the call whether they do international transfers and stuff. But I mean, I explained to him on that phone call that it's going to be money from the US, and it's going to be international transfer and I said, you'll see it on your bank statement as well. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:26\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:28\\n\\nSo how does he think international money is going to come into his bank account without you know signing anything or you know, to my knowledge, you cannot get international money to your account, if you don't like declare it with the what's that email that we sent for that the bank sent?\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:48\\n\\nYeah, that the the bank send its exchange for free?\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:51\\n\\nYes. So the exchange bureau.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:53\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:54\\n\\nAs far as I'm aware, you cannot get money into a South African account without signing the document like that. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:00\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:01\\n\\nSo what was he thinking? If it was an issue? What if you should have said it at that point? And the way they replied to say we're not clicking on any links or filling in any forms? Okay, cool.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:10\\n\\nYeah, yeah. It's, it seems that they they're not accustomed to receiving funds from external suppliers, or international suppliers specificly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:21\\n\\nYeah, and it's kind of a small business, I wanted to support them, because I've worked with them before and, you know, had great experience with them before, but...\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:28\\n\\nyeah, \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:28\\n\\nKind of get the feeling, you know, since the younger generation is taking over, I don't know. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:34\\n\\nYeah, \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:34\\n\\nIt's just been, it's not been pleasant, this experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:37\\n\\nSo unless they've got a lucky card processing facility of some sort, where they can do this online. In other words, you know, go online, and add a bundle of 100 business cards with graphic design and add them to a cart, and then checkout and do that sort of payment process.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:55\\n\\nI doubt, their website doesn't look like that sort of thing. And I mean, if they are dodgy with clicking on links, I don't think.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  02:02\\n\\n Yeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  02:02\\n\\nWe'll have that kind of technology available with the two other people that are waiting to today look like they have like all sorts of cool technology, how you can request quotes and stuff.

Hi, Brazil.  I'm Danelia,  I am the medical writer at Syenza.  I'm also a qualified pharmacist. So I just want to confirm if you've received the email, I've sent over with the information, the feedback that we've gotten so far with the key opinion leaders and the questions that we will be discussing today. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  07:09\\n\\nThank you. Yes, I received it.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  07:30\\n\\nAlright, perfect. So the flow of today is basically what we call a Delphi panel discussion. So we will interview key opinion leaders, and then we get the feedback, we integrate it, send it over to the next person and see if there is commonalities or disagreements and see if we can find a form of consensus during this interview process. So like Joao said before, we've interviewed quite a few other specialists, and now we're going on to you to see if you can agree or disagree with some of the things that have been said. So we've divided the questions into three sections. So we talk about better outcomes in mitral valve surgery, we talk about mitral valve decision making what leads your decision making skills there. And then also talk about a specific of the MITRIS RESILIA valve.  Just to confirm this, this valve is not available in your country as of yet. If I'm correct, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:19\\n\\nFew time. This is available in our country, we the MITRIS received the approval of government for something like 30 days ago. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:35\\n\\nSure. Okay, that's great.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:36\\n\\nJust one month. We have two cases, schedule yet, but I didn't do anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:45\\n\\nAll right. So you are aware of the technology and have some background, at least of what it looks like and the benefits and so forth?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:52\\n\\n Yeah. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:53\\n\\nSure.  Thanks, doctor. So before we start with the questions, if you don't mind if you're comfortable just to give us a little bit of background of the practice that you're currently working at maybe specifying if you do a minimally invasive and so forth, and then we can start with the questions if you're comfortable.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  09:07\\n\\nOkay. You want to answer the questions now? Are you asking me something is perceivable?\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  09:23\\n\\nSo if you can just first give us a little bit of an overview of the practice where you're currently working, just to say maybe what kind of surgeries you do if you do minimally invasive, robotic surgery just so we know that what your background is as well please, doctor?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  09:38\\n\\nI am surgeon 20 years now. And I do a lot of surgeries per day. Something like 300, 305 by year I work in two hospitals, a public hospital and a private hospital. I do something like 70, 80 mitral surgeries by year, something like two per week without vacations etc. And we do mix surgery.  We do specifically valve surgery, mix and vascularization we do full sternotomy without mix, is something like that.  In our practice we have 75 to 80% of repair, mitral repair, few cases of mitral replacement.  We have in my state kind of patients something like Europe or North America.  We have a few cases of rheumatic heart disease but in the rest of country, Brazil, there's a high incidence of rheumatic disease.  There's a different kind of population but we have the almost the same problems with the social economic viability to the public service for premium, let's talk in this manner. Premium valves like my MITRIS like a Magna, like mosaic, we don't have this just kind of protheses in the public health just some brands, national brands like a brylee like a lobby card we have in the the public health.  In the private system, we have all kinds of protheses.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=8279, end_char_idx=11990, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7158828)], metadata={'b351f3a4-e72a-409f-8ac7-0d0dcf24c436': {'file_name': 'Brazil.docx', 'file_path': '/home/kris/dev/syenza-docs/pdfs-tests/Brazil.docx', 'file_type': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'file_size': 62329, 'creation_date': '2024-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2023-11-18'}, '6c0c4d98-bf5c-4abf-bfef-2a732d59c10a': {'file_name': 'Brazil.docx', 'file_path': '/home/kris/dev/syenza-docs/pdfs-tests/Brazil.docx', 'file_type': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 'file_size': 62329, 'creation_date': '2024-07-11', 'last_modified_date': '2023-11-18'}})"

Like they were suspect from the get go, I remember their finance guy would call me and stuff. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:06\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:07\\n\\nAnd I Googled him, he looks like he's the owner's son. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:12\\n\\nOh, I see.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:12\\n\\nBut he's like a production manager or something. So I don't know why he's the one that makes the call whether they do international transfers and stuff. But I mean, I explained to him on that phone call that it's going to be money from the US, and it's going to be international transfer and I said, you'll see it on your bank statement as well. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:26\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:28\\n\\nSo how does he think international money is going to come into his bank account without you know signing anything or you know, to my knowledge, you cannot get international money to your account, if you don't like declare it with the what's that email that we sent for that the bank sent?\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:48\\n\\nYeah, that the the bank send its exchange for free?\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:51\\n\\nYes. So the exchange bureau.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  00:53\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  00:54\\n\\nAs far as I'm aware, you cannot get money into a South African account without signing the document like that. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:00\\n\\nYeah. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:01\\n\\nSo what was he thinking? If it was an issue? What if you should have said it at that point? And the way they replied to say we're not clicking on any links or filling in any forms? Okay, cool.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:10\\n\\nYeah, yeah. It's, it seems that they they're not accustomed to receiving funds from external suppliers, or international suppliers specificly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:21\\n\\nYeah, and it's kind of a small business, I wanted to support them, because I've worked with them before and, you know, had great experience with them before, but...\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:28\\n\\nyeah, \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:28\\n\\nKind of get the feeling, you know, since the younger generation is taking over, I don't know. \\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:34\\n\\nYeah, \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:34\\n\\nIt's just been, it's not been pleasant, this experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  01:37\\n\\nSo unless they've got a lucky card processing facility of some sort, where they can do this online. In other words, you know, go online, and add a bundle of 100 business cards with graphic design and add them to a cart, and then checkout and do that sort of payment process.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  01:55\\n\\nI doubt, their website doesn't look like that sort of thing. And I mean, if they are dodgy with clicking on links, I don't think.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  02:02\\n\\n Yeah.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  02:02\\n\\nWe'll have that kind of technology available with the two other people that are waiting to today look like they have like all sorts of cool technology, how you can request quotes and stuff.

Hi, Brazil.  I'm Danelia,  I am the medical writer at Syenza.  I'm also a qualified pharmacist.

Yes, I received it.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  07:30\\n\\nAlright, perfect. So the flow of today is basically what we call a Delphi panel discussion. So we will interview key opinion leaders, and then we get the feedback, we integrate it, send it over to the next person and see if there is commonalities or disagreements and see if we can find a form of consensus during this interview process. So like Joao said before, we've interviewed quite a few other specialists, and now we're going on to you to see if you can agree or disagree with some of the things that have been said. So we've divided the questions into three sections. So we talk about better outcomes in mitral valve surgery, we talk about mitral valve decision making what leads your decision making skills there. And then also talk about a specific of the MITRIS RESILIA valve.  Just to confirm this, this valve is not available in your country as of yet. If I'm correct, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:19\\n\\nFew time. This is available in our country, we the MITRIS received the approval of government for something like 30 days ago. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:35\\n\\nSure.

The purpose or for the call was reaching out to check on your willingness to participate in research that we've been commissioned to do by Edwards Lifesciences the European office and it's a pleasure to be on the call today together with my colleague Danelia Botes at Syenza.  I thought perhaps to start off with I'd provide you some overview around the the purpose of the call, a little bit about Syenza and then handover immediately to Danelia to facilitate the interview, if that's okay with you?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  05:24\\n\\nOkay, it's okay.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  05:25\\n\\nOkay, perfect. So the research that we're doing is the mitral valve replacement. And it's been commissioned by Edwards Lifesciences. So we've been responsible for developing the interview questions, the interview guides, and also engaging with key opinion leaders internationally. So far, we've completed interviews in Canada, the Netherlands, UK, and Spain. And coming up this week, we've got interviews in Germany and also in Mexico, we're very happy to be on the call today to include Brazil as well. And the research focus is mitral valve replacement. But then also talking about MITRIS RESILIA, the new technology from Edwards Lifesciences. What I did want to mention is before we get started officially is that the conversation is private, and confidential. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  06:13\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  06:14\\n\\nAnything that you share with us on the call will not be provided to Edwards Lifesciences verbatim. We only provide feedback to them in an aggregated form, together with the other key opinion leaders from the countries that are mentioned. And we're just interested in identifying main themes, commonalities and differences. So we welcome your positive opinions and also the negative opinions, right, if, if there are any, okay, we are Syenza. We're a USA based company. We focus on accelerating access to innovative healthcare technologies. Most of our research is on health economics and outcomes research, market access and dynamic intelligence. And I also have an affiliate to assistant professorship at Northeastern University in Boston. So with that being said, and being done, it's a real pleasure to be on the call today.

And then also just to ask doc in Brazil, do the patients have a say when it comes to decision making for the valve? Like do they ask for a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve? Or is it up to the surgeon to decide which valve is being used in the patients?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  18:37\\n\\nNo, we asked for all patients, we discuss with all patients.  Sometimes they don't have no knowledge to understand these things.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  18:56\\n\\nSure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  18:56\\n\\nBut all cases we discuss with the patients and the families.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  19:02\\n\\nOkay. Sure. Does the funding also play a role, the funders that fund for the valves? Do they play a role in your decision making? Do they guide you as well? How does the funding work in Brazil?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  19:17\\n\\nSorry, I didn't understand the...\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  19:20\\n\\nSo you said in the public sector that you don't have access to the premium valves. So I guess in that sector, the private sector you maybe have more decision. You have more valves available, but then who decides in that sector which valves is available? Does the funding mechanisms, the medical insurance also play a role?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  19:43\\n\\nIn the private we don't have problem. We use what I want. But in public health we have just one brand in my hospital I don't have choice. I just choose mechanical or biological.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  20:10\\n\\nOkay, perfect. And then when it comes to biological valves, do you have a preference for bovine versus porcine?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  20:20\\n\\nUntil five years ago, or better, eight years ago, we have a few repairs mitral repairs. So we use a lot of porcine valves, a lot of mosaic valve, Biocare from St. Jude's now Abbott, in mosaic valves.  With the repairs growing a lot, we start with the relationship with  Edwards because the fees are too and the cost growth bands. So we always have the  prosthesis for backup.   So, now use Magna, just because this I don't know, the word was facility is easy to us, because I have the valve. The day there's no a lot of the papers show the porcine is better, but not much better. So Magna is an excellent valvle. There's a better,  mother a mother named Mickey perfu no hyperfuse Bo, yeah. And small posts is better thinking probably a future valve in valve mitral.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  22:10\\n\\nPerfect. Do do you suspect if MITRIS RESILIA comes to the country and the durability of the valve is more? Do you expect a lot of better patient satisfaction of your patients in the hospital and a better quality of life? Or do you not see that making much of a difference from the patient side?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  22:28\\n\\nI think that the patient will be better because a lot of patients today came to us asking for no take anticoagulants.  \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  22:42\\n\\nSure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  22:44\\n\\nI think this conversation with your clinical cardiologist or the internet. So they asking for us for don't take Warfarin. So I think they will be happy with the RESILIA tissue.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  23:05\\n\\nSure. I think that also sort of already asked but if the valve comes in at a bit of a high cost, do you expect it being troublesome to get it into your practice? Or you said that they usually you can use whatever valve you would like to in your patients?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  23:24\\n\\nI think no, because we have to when I asked for a different type of different kinds of protheses, I have to argue with the payer. So if I have the adequate argue with the papers with the territory, there is no problem for us.

Hi, Brazil.  I'm Danelia,  I am the medical writer at Syenza.  I'm also a qualified pharmacist. So I just want to confirm if you've received the email, I've sent over with the information, the feedback that we've gotten so far with the key opinion leaders and the questions that we will be discussing today. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  07:09\\n\\nThank you. Yes, I received it.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  07:30\\n\\nAlright, perfect. So the flow of today is basically what we call a Delphi panel discussion. So we will interview key opinion leaders, and then we get the feedback, we integrate it, send it over to the next person and see if there is commonalities or disagreements and see if we can find a form of consensus during this interview process. So like Joao said before, we've interviewed quite a few other specialists, and now we're going on to you to see if you can agree or disagree with some of the things that have been said. So we've divided the questions into three sections. So we talk about better outcomes in mitral valve surgery, we talk about mitral valve decision making what leads your decision making skills there. And then also talk about a specific of the MITRIS RESILIA valve.  Just to confirm this, this valve is not available in your country as of yet. If I'm correct, right?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:19\\n\\nFew time. This is available in our country, we the MITRIS received the approval of government for something like 30 days ago. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:35\\n\\nSure. Okay, that's great.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:36\\n\\nJust one month. We have two cases, schedule yet, but I didn't do anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:45\\n\\nAll right. So you are aware of the technology and have some background, at least of what it looks like and the benefits and so forth?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  08:52\\n\\n Yeah. \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  08:53\\n\\nSure.  Thanks, doctor. So before we start with the questions, if you don't mind if you're comfortable just to give us a little bit of background of the practice that you're currently working at maybe specifying if you do a minimally invasive and so forth, and then we can start with the questions if you're comfortable.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  09:07\\n\\nOkay. You want to answer the questions now? Are you asking me something is perceivable?\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  09:23\\n\\nSo if you can just first give us a little bit of an overview of the practice where you're currently working, just to say maybe what kind of surgeries you do if you do minimally invasive, robotic surgery just so we know that what your background is as well please, doctor?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  09:38\\n\\nI am surgeon 20 years now. And I do a lot of surgeries per day. Something like 300, 305 by year I work in two hospitals, a public hospital and a private hospital. I do something like 70, 80 mitral surgeries by year, something like two per week without vacations etc. And we do mix surgery.  We do specifically valve surgery, mix and vascularization we do full sternotomy without mix, is something like that.  In our practice we have 75 to 80% of repair, mitral repair, few cases of mitral replacement.  We have in my state kind of patients something like Europe or North America.  We have a few cases of rheumatic heart disease but in the rest of country, Brazil, there's a high incidence of rheumatic disease.  There's a different kind of population but we have the almost the same problems with the social economic viability to the public service for premium, let's talk in this manner. Premium valves like my MITRIS like a Magna, like mosaic, we don't have this just kind of protheses in the public health just some brands, national brands like a brylee like a lobby card we have in the the public health.

So the research that we're doing is the mitral valve replacement. And it's been commissioned by Edwards Lifesciences. So we've been responsible for developing the interview questions, the interview guides, and also engaging with key opinion leaders internationally. So far, we've completed interviews in Canada, the Netherlands, UK, and Spain. And coming up this week, we've got interviews in Germany and also in Mexico, we're very happy to be on the call today to include Brazil as well. And the research focus is mitral valve replacement. But then also talking about MITRIS RESILIA, the new technology from Edwards Lifesciences. What I did want to mention is before we get started officially is that the conversation is private, and confidential. \\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  06:13\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoão Carapinha  06:14\\n\\nAnything that you share with us on the call will not be provided to Edwards Lifesciences verbatim.

And we're just interested in identifying main themes, commonalities and differences. So we welcome your positive opinions and also the negative opinions, right, if, if there are any, okay, we are Syenza. We're a USA based company. We focus on accelerating access to innovative healthcare technologies. Most of our research is on health economics and outcomes research, market access and dynamic intelligence.

And then also just to ask doc in Brazil, do the patients have a say when it comes to decision making for the valve? Like do they ask for a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve? Or is it up to the surgeon to decide which valve is being used in the patients?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  18:37\\n\\nNo, we asked for all patients, we discuss with all patients.  Sometimes they don't have no knowledge to understand these things.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  18:56\\n\\nSure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  18:56\\n\\nBut all cases we discuss with the patients and the families.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  19:02\\n\\nOkay. Sure. Does the funding also play a role, the funders that fund for the valves? Do they play a role in your decision making? Do they guide you as well? How does the funding work in Brazil?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  19:17\\n\\nSorry, I didn't understand the...\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  19:20\\n\\nSo you said in the public sector that you don't have access to the premium valves. So I guess in that sector, the private sector you maybe have more decision. You have more valves available, but then who decides in that sector which valves is available? Does the funding mechanisms, the medical insurance also play a role?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  19:43\\n\\nIn the private we don't have problem. We use what I want. But in public health we have just one brand in my hospital I don't have choice. I just choose mechanical or biological.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  20:10\\n\\nOkay, perfect. And then when it comes to biological valves, do you have a preference for bovine versus porcine?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  20:20\\n\\nUntil five years ago, or better, eight years ago, we have a few repairs mitral repairs. So we use a lot of porcine valves, a lot of mosaic valve, Biocare from St. Jude's now Abbott, in mosaic valves.  With the repairs growing a lot, we start with the relationship with  Edwards because the fees are too and the cost growth bands. So we always have the  prosthesis for backup.   So, now use Magna, just because this I don't know, the word was facility is easy to us, because I have the valve. The day there's no a lot of the papers show the porcine is better, but not much better. So Magna is an excellent valvle. There's a better,  mother a mother named Mickey perfu no hyperfuse Bo, yeah. And small posts is better thinking probably a future valve in valve mitral.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  22:10\\n\\nPerfect. Do do you suspect if MITRIS RESILIA comes to the country and the durability of the valve is more? Do you expect a lot of better patient satisfaction of your patients in the hospital and a better quality of life? Or do you not see that making much of a difference from the patient side?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  22:28\\n\\nI think that the patient will be better because a lot of patients today came to us asking for no take anticoagulants.  \\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  22:42\\n\\nSure.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  22:44\\n\\nI think this conversation with your clinical cardiologist or the internet. So they asking for us for don't take Warfarin. So I think they will be happy with the RESILIA tissue.\\n\\n\\n\\nDanélia Botes  23:05\\n\\nSure. I think that also sort of already asked but if the valve comes in at a bit of a high cost, do you expect it being troublesome to get it into your practice? Or you said that they usually you can use whatever valve you would like to in your patients?\\n\\n\\n\\nBrazil  23:24\\n\\nI think no, because we have to when I asked for a different type of different kinds of protheses, I have to argue with the payer.

So we will interview key opinion leaders, and then we get the feedback, we integrate it, send it over to the next person and see if there is commonalities or disagreements and see if we can find a form of consensus during this interview process. So like Joao said before, we've interviewed quite a few other specialists, and now we're going on to you to see if you can agree or disagree with some of the things that have been said. So we've divided the questions into three sections. So we talk about better outcomes in mitral valve surgery, we talk about mitral valve decision making what leads your decision making skills there.

I do something like 70, 80 mitral surgeries by year, something like two per week without vacations etc. And we do mix surgery.  We do specifically valve surgery, mix and vascularization we do full sternotomy without mix, is something like that.  In our practice we have 75 to 80% of repair, mitral repair, few cases of mitral replacement.  We have in my state kind of patients something like Europe or North America.  We have a few cases of rheumatic heart disease but in the rest of country, Brazil, there's a high incidence of rheumatic disease.  There's a different kind of population but we have the almost the same problems with the social economic viability to the public service for premium, let's talk in this manner. Premium valves like my MITRIS like a Magna, like mosaic, we don't have this just kind of protheses in the public health just some brands, national brands like a brylee like a lobby card we have in the the public health.  In the private system, we have all kinds of protheses.\n",

With the repairs growing a lot, we start with the relationship with  Edwards because the fees are too and the cost growth bands. So we always have the  prosthesis for backup.   So, now use Magna, just because this I don't know, the word was facility is easy to us, because I have the valve. The day there's no a lot of the papers show the porcine is better, but not much better. So Magna is an excellent valvle. There's a better,  mother a mother named Mickey perfu no hyperfuse Bo, yeah.
