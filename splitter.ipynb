[12] reported excellent outcomes on robotic MVR\\nwith mechanical valves. However, limited data are available on ro-botic MVR with bioprosthetic valves due to the challenges involvedin valve implantation. With the increase in the use of bioprostheticvalves worldwide [ 2] and strong patient desire for minimally inva-\\nsive procedures [ 13], the safety and feasibility of robotic MVRs with\\nbioprosthetic valves require investigation. Thus, the aim of thisretrospective cohort study was to analyse initial experiences andmid-term clinical outcomes in our tertiary referral hospital.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nBetween January 2013 and May 2017, 200 robotic cardiac surgerieswere performed at the Chi Mei Medical Center using the da VinciSi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ofthem, 52 consecutive patients underwent robotic MVR with bio-prosthetic valves. The following patients were excluded from theanalysis: patients requiring an additional cardiac procedure on theaortic valve, aorta or coronary arteries; those previously operatedon the right chest and those with pulmonary infection. All surgicalprocedures were performed by a single console surgeon, as well asa table surgeon. Preoperative workup included transthoracic echo-cardiography and computed tomographic angiography of thechest, abdomen and pelvis. In addition, coronary angiography was\\nindicated for patients with the potential for coronary artery disease.\\nTricuspid valve repairs were perfo rmed in patients with moderate-\\nto-severe secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. The radiofre-quency Cox-maze IV procedure was performed in patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation. Left atrial appendage obliteration wasperformed in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation since July 2015. Thehospital’s institutional review board approved the study protocol.\\nSurgical technique\\nAfter the induction of general anaesthesia, patients were intu-bated smoothly as usual. A central venous catheter and a 6.5-Frintroducer sheath were placed into the right internal jugular vein.Patients were positioned in the supine position with the rightchest elevated approximately 30\\n/C14and the right arm tucked at the\\nside. External deﬁbrillator pads were placed properly. A multi-plane transoesophageal echocardiography probe was insertedbefore incision to conﬁrm the severity of the valvular heart dis-\\nease. A 2-cm oblique right groin incision was made for peripheralcannulation. After systemic heparinization, cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was established under transoesophageal echocardiog-raphy guidance. The patient’s femoral artery was cannulated forsystemic retrograde perfusion. Adjunctive distal femoral perfu-sion was achieved using an 8-Fr arterial cannula (Medtronic,Minneapolis, MN, USA). Bicaval venous drainage was initiatedthrough the right internal jugular vein and femoral vein.\\nThe da Vinci Si robotic patient cart approached the patient\\nperpendicularly from the left side. A 12-mm camera port (XcelBladeless Trocar, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) was initially\\nintroduced into the right 4th intercostal space (ICS) on the mid-\\nclavicular line. A right robot arm port (8 mm) was placed in theright 6th ICS on the anterior axillary line. A right assisted robotarm was placed in the right 5th ICS on the parasternal border. Aleft robot arm port (8 mm) was placed in the right 2nd ICS onthe midclavicular line. A 3-cm horizontal incision was fashionedin the right 4th ICS with a retractor (Tedan Surgical Innovations,Houston, TX, USA) as a working port (Fig. 1A). A transthoracic\\nChitwood cross-clamp (Scanlan International, Minneapolis, MN,USA) was placed at the right 4th ICS and midaxillary line. A cardi-oplegia venting catheter (14G BD Angiocath) was insertedthrough the right 2nd ICS on the parasternal border and directlyinto the ascending aorta. A 4-0 prolene loop was superﬁciallysutured on the proximal part of catheter. Then, it was snared by2-0 Ti-Cron sutures with Teﬂon pledgets on the ascending aorta.After aortic cross-clamping (ACC), myocardial protection wasachieved using an antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia of histi-dine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution (30 ml/kg; CustodiolHTK; Ko ¨hler Chemie GmbH, Bensheim, Germany).\\nStandard MVR techniques were performed. The left atrium\\nwas opened parallel to the interatrial groove. The mitral valvewas exposed using a dynamic atrial retractor. A ﬂexible drainagecatheter was placed in the left superior pulmonary vein to obtaina clear operative ﬁeld. For patients with Barlow’s deformity anddilated cardiomyopathy, bileaﬂet preservation was performed;for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, posterior mitral leaﬂetpreservation was performed; and for patients with infectiveendocarditis and prosthesis degeneration, the diseased valve wasexcised. Initially, 2-0 double-armed Ti-Cron sutures (CovidienInc., Dublin, Ireland) were anchored to the annulus with Teﬂon\\nFigure 1: External view.

Two suture guiders were estab-\\nlished to maintain the order of the stitches. The sutures werethen placed in the bioprosthesis suture ring outside the chestwall (Fig. 1B), and the bioprosthetic valves were securely im-\\nplanted into the position without debris interference in valvefunction. Under a 10-fold robotic videoscope, each stitch wasconﬁrmed and knotted using the robot arms or COR-KNOT de-vice (LSI solutions, Victor, NY, USA). The left atriotomy was closedwith 3-0 polytetraﬂuoroethylene running suture (W. L. Gore &Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA). The de-airing procedure wasconducted through the cardioplegia venting catheter, and theChitwood cross-clamp was released. After conﬁrming heart valveprosthesis function, the patient was weaned off CPB. Two or 310-mm closed wound vacuum drains were placed in the rightpleural cavity. The wound was closed in layers.\\nFor patients with concomitant tricuspid procedures, the right\\natrium should be opened. The superior vena cava and inferiorvena cava were snared with a yellow tape. For patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation, a radiofrequency ablation pen(Medtronic) was used to complete the left atrial or biatrial Cox-maze IV procedure, including the box lesion, left atrial append-age line and mitral isthmus line as left atrial lesions and superiorvena cava line, inferior vena cava line and right atrial free wallline as right atrial lesions. Initial energy was set at 30 J and ad-justed according to the reaction of the atrial tissue to the radio-frequency. The left atrial appendage was obliterated by a 2-0 Ti-Cron continuous suture with Teﬂon pledgets. For patientsundergoing a redo operation, an intracavitary temporary pacing\\nwire (BM604ABB, MCE, Gemert, Netherlands) was ﬁxed into the\\nleft ventricular endocardium instead of the right ventricular ad-hesive epicardium and positioned between the annulus and su-ture ring of the mitral prosthesis (Fig. 2).\\nFollow-up\\nData were obtained until September 2017. All patients were ﬁrst\\nevaluated 2 weeks after the operation. Further clinical follow-upwas conducted through biannual visits to the outpatient clinicand phone contact. Vitamin K antagonists were used as anti-coagulants in the 1st 3 months after bioprosthetic valve implant-ation, then discontinued unless patients had other indications foranticoagulation. Serial echocardiographic data were recorded toevaluate the bioprosthesis function, heart function and remodel-ling of the left atrium and left ventricle. All patients receivedechocardiography follow-up at least once in this review. In eachpatient undergoing a Cox-maze IV procedure, the 12-lead elec-\\ntrocardiogram was investigated every 3 months, and a routine24-h Holter was arranged annually or at any time when the pa-tient was symptomatic.\\nStatistical methods\\nContinuous variables are summarized as means ± standard devi-ation or medians (ranges). Categorical variables are summarized asfrequencies (percentages). The EuroSCORE II was calculated usingan online calculator. ACC and CPB times were analysed using anon-linear regression model ( r\\n2) to assess learning period effects.\\nMoreover, isolated MVRs and complicated MVRs with concomitantprocedures were analysed separately. The unpaired, 2-tailedStudent’s t-test was used to measure differences between preopera-\\ntive and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography ﬁndings.

[12] reported excellent outcomes on robotic MVR\\nwith mechanical valves. However, limited data are available on ro-botic MVR with bioprosthetic valves due to the challenges involvedin valve implantation. With the increase in the use of bioprostheticvalves worldwide [ 2] and strong patient desire for minimally inva-\\nsive procedures [ 13], the safety and feasibility of robotic MVRs with\\nbioprosthetic valves require investigation. Thus, the aim of thisretrospective cohort study was to analyse initial experiences andmid-term clinical outcomes in our tertiary referral hospital.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nBetween January 2013 and May 2017, 200 robotic cardiac surgerieswere performed at the Chi Mei Medical Center using the da VinciSi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ofthem, 52 consecutive patients underwent robotic MVR with bio-prosthetic valves. The following patients were excluded from theanalysis: patients requiring an additional cardiac procedure on theaortic valve, aorta or coronary arteries; those previously operatedon the right chest and those with pulmonary infection. All surgicalprocedures were performed by a single console surgeon, as well asa table surgeon. Preoperative workup included transthoracic echo-cardiography and computed tomographic angiography of thechest, abdomen and pelvis. In addition, coronary angiography was\\nindicated for patients with the potential for coronary artery disease.\\nTricuspid valve repairs were perfo rmed in patients with moderate-\\nto-severe secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. The radiofre-quency Cox-maze IV procedure was performed in patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation. Left atrial appendage obliteration wasperformed in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation since July 2015. Thehospital’s institutional review board approved the study protocol.\\nSurgical technique\\nAfter the induction of general anaesthesia, patients were intu-bated smoothly as usual. A central venous catheter and a 6.5-Frintroducer sheath were placed into the right internal jugular vein.Patients were positioned in the supine position with the rightchest elevated approximately 30\\n/C14and the right arm tucked at the\\nside. External deﬁbrillator pads were placed properly. A multi-plane transoesophageal echocardiography probe was insertedbefore incision to conﬁrm the severity of the valvular heart dis-\\nease. A 2-cm oblique right groin incision was made for peripheralcannulation. After systemic heparinization, cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was established under transoesophageal echocardiog-raphy guidance. The patient’s femoral artery was cannulated forsystemic retrograde perfusion. Adjunctive distal femoral perfu-sion was achieved using an 8-Fr arterial cannula (Medtronic,Minneapolis, MN, USA). Bicaval venous drainage was initiatedthrough the right internal jugular vein and femoral vein.\\nThe da Vinci Si robotic patient cart approached the patient\\nperpendicularly from the left side. A 12-mm camera port (XcelBladeless Trocar, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) was initially\\nintroduced into the right 4th intercostal space (ICS) on the mid-\\nclavicular line. A right robot arm port (8 mm) was placed in theright 6th ICS on the anterior axillary line. A right assisted robotarm was placed in the right 5th ICS on the parasternal border. Aleft robot arm port (8 mm) was placed in the right 2nd ICS onthe midclavicular line. A 3-cm horizontal incision was fashionedin the right 4th ICS with a retractor (Tedan Surgical Innovations,Houston, TX, USA) as a working port (Fig. 1A). A transthoracic\\nChitwood cross-clamp (Scanlan International, Minneapolis, MN,USA) was placed at the right 4th ICS and midaxillary line. A cardi-oplegia venting catheter (14G BD Angiocath) was insertedthrough the right 2nd ICS on the parasternal border and directlyinto the ascending aorta. A 4-0 prolene loop was superﬁciallysutured on the proximal part of catheter. Then, it was snared by2-0 Ti-Cron sutures with Teﬂon pledgets on the ascending aorta.After aortic cross-clamping (ACC), myocardial protection wasachieved using an antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia of histi-dine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution (30 ml/kg; CustodiolHTK; Ko ¨hler Chemie GmbH, Bensheim, Germany).\\nStandard MVR techniques were performed. The left atrium\\nwas opened parallel to the interatrial groove. The mitral valvewas exposed using a dynamic atrial retractor. A ﬂexible drainagecatheter was placed in the left superior pulmonary vein to obtaina clear operative ﬁeld. For patients with Barlow’s deformity anddilated cardiomyopathy, bileaﬂet preservation was performed;for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, posterior mitral leaﬂetpreservation was performed; and for patients with infectiveendocarditis and prosthesis degeneration, the diseased valve wasexcised. Initially, 2-0 double-armed Ti-Cron sutures (CovidienInc., Dublin, Ireland) were anchored to the annulus with Teﬂon\\nFigure 1: External view.

Two suture guiders were estab-\\nlished to maintain the order of the stitches. The sutures werethen placed in the bioprosthesis suture ring outside the chestwall (Fig. 1B), and the bioprosthetic valves were securely im-\\nplanted into the position without debris interference in valvefunction. Under a 10-fold robotic videoscope, each stitch wasconﬁrmed and knotted using the robot arms or COR-KNOT de-vice (LSI solutions, Victor, NY, USA). The left atriotomy was closedwith 3-0 polytetraﬂuoroethylene running suture (W. L. Gore &Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA). The de-airing procedure wasconducted through the cardioplegia venting catheter, and theChitwood cross-clamp was released. After conﬁrming heart valveprosthesis function, the patient was weaned off CPB. Two or 310-mm closed wound vacuum drains were placed in the rightpleural cavity. The wound was closed in layers.\\nFor patients with concomitant tricuspid procedures, the right\\natrium should be opened. The superior vena cava and inferiorvena cava were snared with a yellow tape. For patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation, a radiofrequency ablation pen(Medtronic) was used to complete the left atrial or biatrial Cox-maze IV procedure, including the box lesion, left atrial append-age line and mitral isthmus line as left atrial lesions and superiorvena cava line, inferior vena cava line and right atrial free wallline as right atrial lesions. Initial energy was set at 30 J and ad-justed according to the reaction of the atrial tissue to the radio-frequency. The left atrial appendage was obliterated by a 2-0 Ti-Cron continuous suture with Teﬂon pledgets. For patientsundergoing a redo operation, an intracavitary temporary pacing\\nwire (BM604ABB, MCE, Gemert, Netherlands) was ﬁxed into the\\nleft ventricular endocardium instead of the right ventricular ad-hesive epicardium and positioned between the annulus and su-ture ring of the mitral prosthesis (Fig. 2).\\nFollow-up\\nData were obtained until September 2017. All patients were ﬁrst\\nevaluated 2 weeks after the operation. Further clinical follow-upwas conducted through biannual visits to the outpatient clinicand phone contact. Vitamin K antagonists were used as anti-coagulants in the 1st 3 months after bioprosthetic valve implant-ation, then discontinued unless patients had other indications foranticoagulation. Serial echocardiographic data were recorded toevaluate the bioprosthesis function, heart function and remodel-ling of the left atrium and left ventricle. All patients receivedechocardiography follow-up at least once in this review. In eachpatient undergoing a Cox-maze IV procedure, the 12-lead elec-\\ntrocardiogram was investigated every 3 months, and a routine24-h Holter was arranged annually or at any time when the pa-tient was symptomatic.\\nStatistical methods\\nContinuous variables are summarized as means ± standard devi-ation or medians (ranges). Categorical variables are summarized asfrequencies (percentages). The EuroSCORE II was calculated usingan online calculator. ACC and CPB times were analysed using anon-linear regression model ( r\\n2) to assess learning period effects.\\nMoreover, isolated MVRs and complicated MVRs with concomitantprocedures were analysed separately. The unpaired, 2-tailedStudent’s t-test was used to measure differences between preopera-\\ntive and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography ﬁndings.

Mean transprosthetic pressure gra-\\ndient was 3.64 ± 3 mmHg in the postoperative follow-up.\\nDISCUSSION\\nAccording to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult CardiacSurgery Database, the use of bioprosthetic valves has dramatic-ally increased, whereas the use of mechanical valves is in decline[2]. From the majority of centres in North America, the use of mi-\\ntral bioprostheses has increased from 32% in 2000 to 63% in2007. Moreover, the patients receiving bioprosthetic valves are\\nincreasingly young. Gammie et al. [2] concluded that improved\\nsurgical outcomes in reoperative mitral valve surgery and the sat-isfactory long-term durability of current-generation bioprosthe-ses have probably contributed to this fundamental shift. Inaddition, activity constraints and complex monitoring protocolfor anticoagulation therapy and the risks of thromboembolic andbleeding events have affected the rejection of mechanical valvesby patients [ 14].\\nMinimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) includes par-\\ntial sternotomy, right anterolateral thoracotomy, right mini-thoracotomy, endoscopic-assisted mini-thoracotomy and robot-assisted surgery. MIMVS is beneﬁcial in terms of cosmetic ap-pearance, reduced postoperative pain, lower blood transfusion\\nrate, shorter length of hospital stay and faster return to daily\\nactivities [ 7–12]. There has been an increased interest in MIMVS\\nin recent decades. Using data from a nationwide surgical data-base (Japan), Nishi et al. [13] have demonstrated that the rate of\\nMIMVS has increased from 5.7% in 2008 to 15.6% in 2012. Morerecently, in a retrospective cohort of 1257 patients undergoingrobotic mitral valve surgery, Murphy et al. [10] reported a signiﬁ-\\ncant rate of acceptance of robotic mitral valve surgery: an in-crease from 46% in the 1st year of its institution to more than90% in the last 3 years. However, despite the marked growth ofMIMVS, most included in previous reports have been mitral valverepair procedures [ 7–10], whereas our series focused on valve\\nreplacement.\\nThis cohort study pertains to clinical outcomes of robotic MVR\\nwith bioprosthetic valves. Although MVR can be performed withsatisfactory outcomes using a minimally invasive endoscopictechnique [ 9], robot arms are comparably strong for extensive\\ndebridement of a severely calciﬁed annulus. In addition, biopros-thetic valves have a higher proﬁle and a wide, saddle-shaped cuffthat are considered technical challenges when implanting themthrough a small surgical wound. Using advanced robotic equip-ment, including a dynamic atrial retractor, delicate articulatedarms and a 3-dimensional high-deﬁnition videoscope, they canbe implanted properly without entrapment of stitches. Our cur-rent results compare favourably with published standards [ 7–12].\\nThere was no operative mortality, and late cardiac-related mor-tality occurred in 1 patient due to irreversible dilated cardiomy-opathy. Serial echocardiography demonstrated a signiﬁcantreduction in left atrial dimension, left ventricular end-diastolic di-mension and left ventricular end-systolic dimension.Table 3: Postoperative outcomes and complications ( n= 52)\\nProsthesis degeneration, n (%) 0 (0)\\n30-Day mortality, n(%) 0 (0)\\nLate mortality, n(%) 4 (7.7)\\nProlonged ventilation (>24 h), n(%) 7 (13.5)\\nPostoperative IABP support, n(%) 2 (3.8)\\nHigh-volume RBC transfusion (>2 U), n(%) 3 (5.8)\\nComplications, n(%)\\nRe-exploration for bleeding 1 (1.9)Sternotomy conversion 1 (1.9)\\nMyocardial infarction 0 (0)\\nStroke 1 (1.9)Reversible neurological injury 2 (3.8)Unilateral pulmonary oedema 4 (7.7)\\nLow cardiac output 1 (1.9)\\nPhrenic nerve palsy 0 (0)Wound infection 0 (0)Limb ischaemia 0 (0)\\nAortic dissection 0 (0)\\nPermanent pacemaker implantation 1 (1.9)New haemodialysis 0 (0)New onset atrial ﬁbrillation 2 (3.8)\\nIABP: intra-aortic balloon pumping; RBC: red blood cell.Table 4: Echocardiographic data ( n= 52)\\nVariables Preoperative,\\nmean ± SDPostoperative,\\nmean ± SDP-value\\nLVEF (%) 65.5 ± 10.8 66.4 ± 10.4 0.61\\nLA dimension (mm) 51.4 ± 11.5 42.6 ± 10.1 <0.01\\nLVESD (mm) 32.8 ± 8.3 29.8 ± 7.1 <0.01\\nLVEDD (mm) 52.1 ± 10.5 47.2 ± 8.7 <0.01RVSP (mmHg) 37.2 ± 19.3 31.8 ± 15.8 0.10Mean TPG (mmHg) 3.64 ± 3\\nLA: left atrium; LVEDD: left ventricular end-diastolic dimension; LVEF: left\\nventricular ejection fraction; LVESD: left ventricular end-systolic dimension;\\nRVSP: right ventricular systolic pressure; SD: standard deviation; TPG: trans-\\nprosthetic pressure gradient.\\nCONVENTIONAL\\nVALVE OPERATIONS5 C.-C.

Few centres in Asia launched the robotic programmedue to concerns about its safety, complexity and costs [ 15].

In our protocol, cerebral oximeter (INVOS,\\nMedtronic) was used during MIMVS, and no patient experiencedintraoperative stroke. Although 1 patient did experience stroke,this was due to low cardiac output syndrome in the postopera-tive recovery period; 2 other patients had reversible neurologicalinjury during mid-term follow-up.

The mechanism is thought to be associated with theischaemia–reperfusion injury to the lung, as well as the general-ized inﬂammatory response, leading to higher vascular perme-ability with subsequent pulmonary oedema [ 17–19]. Moss et al.\\n[19] have made some modiﬁcations to reduce the incidence, and\\nwe have made similar efforts in our projects. Unilateral pulmon-ary oedema eliminated within the preceding 2 years may beattributed to the following intraoperative strategies: maintainingadequate arterial inﬂow, shortening CPB time and implementingpulmonary recruitment manoeuvres.\\nIn our series, mean ACC and CPB times were slightly extended,\\nwhich was mainly attributed to the 73.1% of patients who under-went concomitant procedures. In addition, extensive decalciﬁca-tion in rheumatic mitral stenosis is another reason for theprolonged operative time. Despite the longer operative time, werevealed an improvement after overcoming the learning curve\\nand understanding the applications of new devices. Both ACC\\nand CPB times improved remarkably with experience (Fig. 3). In\\nthe last 10 cases, the COR-KNOT device was used for mitral pros-thesis ﬁxation, signiﬁcantly reducing the knotting time from 30to 6 min.\\nThe development of MIMVS has greatly inﬂuenced the surgical\\ntechniques and clinical outcomes of reoperative cardiac surgery.Minimally invasive approaches can lower the risk of damage tocardiac structure. Series reports have presented favourable re-sults, with 30-day mortality rates of approximately 3–5% [ 20–22].\\nSince our programme was initiated in 2013, we have performed7 reoperative robotic MVRs, including 5 patients under aortic-clamping arrested heart status (this study) and 2 patients undernon-clamping ﬁbrillating heart condition. Average intraoperativeblood loss was 300 ml. All patients resumed their daily taskswithin a week after the operation. An intracavitary temporarypacing wire was placed into the left ventricular endocardium,which is a standard procedure in our reoperative robotic MVR(Fig. 2). This technique was initially described by Casselman et al.\\n[22] in their endoscopic redo mitral and tricuspid valve surgery.\\nHowever, slightly different from the ordinary method, welaunched an innovative concept to place the intracavitary pacingwire between the mitral annulus and prosthetic suture ring. Thus,the pacing wire does not compromise the leaﬂet coaptation ordamage the prosthesis. In this study, all intracavitary pacing wirefunctioned well, and they were removed 1 week postoperativelywithout thromboembolic or bleeding events.\\nAnother important ﬁnding of this study is the high rate of con-\\ncomitant Cox-maze IV procedure performed. Atrial ﬁbrillationrates vary between 30% and 50% among patients undergoingmitral valve surgery, which can increase the risk of stroke and re-\\nduce survival. In a randomized control trial, Gillinov et al. [23]\\ndemonstrated that patients undergoing the surgical ablation inaddition to mitral valve surgery had signiﬁcantly increased ratesof freedom from atrial ﬁbrillation. As with minimally invasivetechniques for mitral valve surgery, an increasing trend of interestwas noted for the maze procedure. Nifong et al. [24] conducted\\nthe 1st and largest study to date evaluating the clinical outcomesfollowing robotic mitral valve repair concomitant with the mazeprocedure; 96.5% of patients reported freedom from atrial ﬁbril-lation without taking antiarrhythmic drugs or warfarin. In ourstudy, sinus rhythm was restored in nearly 90% of patients. Mostcan discontinue warfarin or downgrade to antiplatelet therapyafter the blanking period. In patients with mitral valve diseaseand atrial ﬁbrillation, our limited experience provides a new per-spective for bioprosthesis implantation in combination with ag-gressive restoration of sinus rhythm.\\nLimitations\\nThis study has the inherent limitations of a retrospective observa-tional data collected from a relatively small population in a singlecentre. Given that this is not a randomized study, surgeon biascannot be ignored. Prior to valve replacement, valve repair was at-tempted. Therefore, only patients with irreparable mitral valve dis-ease underwent valve replacement surgery, which limited thenumber of cases studied. All patients received at least once echo-cardiography follow-up after the operation. However, the pre-operative echocardiography and postoperative echocardiographywere not performed by a single cardiologist. Finally, there was nocontrol group to compare our study group within this series, be-cause, since 2013, most patients have undergone robotic cardiacsurgery instead of conventional sternotomy in our institution.Thus, a well-designed study is required to validate the advantagesof robotic MVR.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn conclusion, robotic MVR with bioprosthetic valves is safe, feas-ible and reproducible with encouraging clinical outcomes. BothACC and CPB times can improve remarkably with experience.Although the preliminary data suggest acceptable echocardio-graphic results, a long-term follow-up remains necessary to under-stand the beneﬁts of robotic MVR with bioprosthetic valves.\\nConﬂict of interest: none declared.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Rofﬁ M, Alﬁeri O, Agewall S, Ahlsson A, Barbato E, Bueno H et al . 2017\\nESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease.

The best 202 matches from the \\nMI group and the MS group were analyzed. The clinical data of the two groups were collected, including \\npreoperative cardiac function, operative data, postoperative complications, and follow-up.\\nResults:  A final total of 404 patients were included in this study after propensity score matching; the \\nMIs group and the MS group each contained 202 patients. The two groups were similar in age, weight, \\npathological changes, and surgical approach. Compared with the MS group, the MIs group had a longer \\ncardiopulmonary bypass time (P<0.001), aortic cross-clamping time (P<0.001), and total procedure time \\n(P<0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding in-hospital mortality, stroke, \\npneumonia, acute renal failure, arrhythmia, and chylothorax. The MS group had significantly more patients \\nwith poor wound healing than the MIs group (P=0.004). The MI group had a lower rate of transfusion \\n(P=0.037), shorter ventilation time (P=0.041), shorter ICU stay (P=0.033), reduced chest tube drainage \\nand length of chest tube stay (P<0.001), and shorter hospital stay (P<0.001). There was no significant \\ndifference between the groups in hospital re-admission for bleeding, but the total hospitalization cost was \\nhigher in the MIs group (P=0.002). The mean follow-up was 26.59±12.33 months, the 1-year postoperative \\nsurvival rate was 98.86%, and the overall survival rate was 97.44%. Compared with the MS group, the MIs \\ngroup recovered earlier (P<0.05), and returned to work or study earlier (P<0.05). More patients in the MIs \\ngroup were satisfied with the wound (P<0.001). The MS group had a higher incidence of postoperative \\nosteomyelitis than the MIs group (P=0.028). There were no significant differences between groups in rates \\nof mortality, stroke, pacemaker, reoperation, or 36-item Short Form Health Survey score.\\nConclusions:  Compared with the MS approach, the MIs method of mitral valve replacement has longer \\ncardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time; however, it does not increase the risk of mortality 341', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In order \\nto improve postoperative outcomes, minimally invasive \\napproaches including via an upper and lower incision on \\nthe sternum and via left and right anterolateral incisions \\nhave been performed (2,3). Compared to conventional MS, \\nthese minimally invasive approaches reduce trauma to the \\nsternum but still require exposure of the ascending aorta \\nand the superior and inferior vena cava (IVC) to establish \\nthe central cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which limits \\nfurther minimization of invasiveness in cardiac surgery.\\nWith the innovation of the port access approach in the \\nlate 1990s, the success of the first thoracoscopic-assisted \\nminimally invasive mitral valve (MV) surgery via a small \\nright anterolateral incision had shown that minimally \\ninvasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery with peripheral CPB \\nwas as feasible, safe, and effective as the conventional MS \\napproach (2,4-8). However, performing a thoracoscopic \\ncardiac surgery usually meant the surgeon was limited to a \\nvery narrow surgical field with poor exposure and required \\nthe use of long-shafted endoscopic instruments, which \\nmarkedly increased the learning difficulty and learning \\ncurve (9,10). Furthermore, early research showed that the \\nCPB time and aortic cross-clamping time in minimally \\ninvasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery was significantly \\nlonger than that in MS, and the risk of stroke was higher in \\nthe minimally invasive group (11-13).\\nIn this study, propensity score matching (PSM) was used \\nto enable proper comparative retrospective analysis of the \\ndata from patients who underwent MV replacement (MVR) \\nsurgery via minimally invasive thoracoscopy versus those \\nwho underwent traditional MS, to determine and compare \\nthe short-term mortality and long-term post cardiac surgery outcomes of these two approaches. This study was aimed \\nto evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopic cardiac \\nsurgery and provide guidance for surgeons who intend to \\nperform thoracoscopic cardiac surgery in China.\\nMethods\\nPatients\\nFrom January 1st, 2012 to June 30th, 2015, a total of 1,096 \\npatients who underwent MVR surgery concomitant \\nwith tricuspid valve surgery or atrial fibrillation ablation \\ntherapy in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery \\nof Guangdong Cardiovascular Institute were analyzed. \\nPatients undergoing other concomitant procedures such as \\naortic surgery, aortic valve replacement, or coronary artery \\nbypass graft were excluded. Patients who were younger than \\n18 years old, or undergoing a second MVR or conversion \\nto MVR from a mitral valvuloplasty procedure were also \\nexcluded. Emergency surgery cases were also excluded from \\nthis study. Of the 1,096 patients, 405 were operated on with \\na minimally invasive surgery of the MVR (MIs-MVR), and \\n691 cases were operated on with MS-MVR.\\nThe primary outcome was a composite end point \\nconsisting of all important adverse events, including 30-day \\nmortality, stroke, aortic dissection, perioperative myocardial \\ninfarction, new atrial fibrillation, intraoperative conversion \\nto sternotomy, re-exploration for bleeding, and low-cardiac-\\noutput syndrome with necessity for intra-aortic balloon \\npump.

Patient temperature was cooled \\nto 34 ℃, and vacuum-assisted CPB was used throughout the \\nprocedure. \\nThe surgical approach was performed via two ports in \\nthe right chest ( Figure 1 ).\\nMain port\\nA right lateral mini-thoracotomy, about 3.5–4.0 cm in \\nlength, was performed in the 4th intercostal space; the \\nspecific size should be sufficient for the artificial valve to be \\npassed through. For male patients, the incision was placed \\njust below and lateral to the nipple, and for female patients, \\nthe incision was placed in the sub-mammary crease.

The PSM was \\nperformed by matching patients in the two groups at a \\n1:1 ratio, without replacement, by the nearest neighbor \\ntechnique. PSM was performed with age, sex, L V ejection \\nfraction (L VEF), pulmonary artery pressure, Euroscore \\nII value, type of lesion, and surgical technique as the \\nobservation indicators, and using SPSS 21.0 software (IBM, \\nArmonk, NY, USA). This resulted in 404 matched cases: \\n202 in the MIs group, and 202 in the MS group. The \\ncriterion for matching pairs used a caliper width equal to \\n0.2 of the pooled SD of the logit of propensity score. After \\nmatching, there was no significant difference between the \\ntwo groups in New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac \\nfunction classification, valvular lesion type, or surgical \\ntechnique (all P>0.05, T able 1 ).\\nNormal distributed continuous variables are expressed \\nas the mean ± standard deviation, and categorical variables \\nas proportions throughout this study. Continuous variables \\nwere analyzed using the Student’s t-test or the Mann-\\nWhitney U test of two independent samples. Categorical \\nvariables were analyzed using the χ2 test. Survival curves \\nwere analyzed with Kaplan-Meier actuarial methods, \\nand log-rank was used to detect the differences between \\ngroups. All tests were two-tailed, and P values <0.05 \\nwere considered significant. SPSS 21.0 software was used \\nfor the statistical analyses, and the follow-up data were \\nrecorded using EpiData software (Version 3.1, Odense,  \\nDenmark, 2004). \\nResults\\nMVR surgery was successfully completed in the two \\nmatched groups of patients, with no cases of surgical \\nfailure. There was no intraoperative conversion to median \\nthoracotomy surgery in the MIs group. Compared with \\nthe MS group, the MIs group had significantly longer \\nCPB time, aortic cross-clamping time, and operation \\ntime (P<0.001), but a significantly lower intraoperative \\ntransfusion rate and fewer transfusion units (both P<0.05, \\nT able 2 ).\\nThe early postoperative data showed that the MS group, \\nwhen compared with the MIs group, had a significantly \\nlonger length of ventilation and ICU stay, significantly increased chest tube drainage, significantly increased \\npostoperative transfusion rate and volume, significantly \\nlonger duration of chest tube drainage and postoperative \\nhospital stay, and significantly increased total hospitalization \\ncost (all P <0.05, T able 3 ). However, there was no significant \\ndifference between groups in the need for re-exploration for \\nbleeding and postoperative L VEF . There was no significant \\ndifference between the two groups in the morbidity rate of \\nin-hospital death, stroke, pulmonary infection, arrhythmia, \\nacute renal failure, or chylothorax, but the MS group had \\na significantly increased incision infection rate (P =0.004), \\nand a significantly higher morbidity rate of all the early \\npostoperative complications (P =0.038, T ables 3,4 ).\\nIn this study, 8 patients died during early postoperative \\nhospitalization (3 in the MIs group and 5 in the MS group). \\nCause of death in the MIs group was stroke, lung infection, \\nand disseminated intravascular coagulation (n=2); and \\npulmonary infection and malignant arrhythmia (n=1). In the \\nMS group, cause of death was stroke, pulmonary infection \\nand multiple organ failure (n=2); low cardiac output \\nsyndrome and malignant cardiac arrhythmia (n=1); and \\npulmonary infection and renal failure (n=2).\\nT elephone or outpatient follow-up was conducted for \\na total of 396 patients (199 in the MIs group, and 197 in \\nthe MS group) who were discharged from the hospital  \\n6–48 months postoperatively, with an average follow-\\nup period of 26.59±12.33 months. There was a total of \\n361 valid follow-ups, with 35 patients being unable to be \\nfollowed up due to change of contact information (16 in the \\nMIs group and 19 in the MS group); the withdrawal rate \\nwas 8.84%.\\nNine patients (2.27%) died during follow-up. In the MIs \\ngroup, 2 patients died of stroke and pulmonary infection, \\n1 died of malignant cardiac arrhythmia, and 1 died of \\nunknown causes. In the MS group, 2 patients died from \\nstroke, 2 died from renal failure and pulmonary infection, \\nand there was 1 case of sudden death for unknown reasons. \\nA comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( Figure 2 ) \\nand log-rank testing showed no significant difference in \\nsurvival between the two groups (P =0.836). There was no \\nsignificant difference between the two groups in the rate of \\nreoperation, the need to install a permanent pacemaker, or \\nthe incidence of stroke ( T able 5 ).

Moreover, the morbidity of all \\npostoperative complications was significantly lower in the \\nMIs group compared to the MS group.\\nMinimally invasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery may potentially have benefits over traditional thoracotomy. \\nThoracoscopic cardiac surgery is conducted through a \\nsmall incision on the right chest, which does not damage \\nthe median sternum and thus greatly reduces the degree of \\nsurgical trauma compared with conventional sternotomy. \\nThe intercostal port and tissue retractor markedly reduce \\nthe damage and pain caused to the surrounding muscle \\ntissues (20). The applications of a high-resolution graphic \\nsystem and 10 mm camera lens enable a more precise and \\nclearer surgical vision, which provides better observation of \\nintraoperative bleeding and allows more accurate operation. \\nTherefore, it reduces transfusion rate and transfusion-\\nrelated complications, postoperative chest tube drainage, \\nand length of chest tube drainage stay (18,19). In this study, \\nthe MIs group had significantly less chest tube drainage, \\nshorter stay of chest tube drainage, a lower rate of intra- \\nand postoperative transfusion, and a lower transfusion \\nvolume than the MS group.\\nMinimally invasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery \\nimproves early postoperative recovery compared with MS. \\nThoracoscopic cardiac surgery maintains the integrity and \\nstability of the thorax and decreases the early postoperative \\nincision pain compared with the MS approach. Minimally \\ninvasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery is also conducive \\nto early postoperative respiratory function recovery and \\nshortens the ventilation time and ICU stay. In addition, \\nearlier postoperative off-bed activity is conducive to \\ngastrointestinal motility and reduces the incidence of \\npostoperative complications related to long-term rest in \\nbed (12,19,20). Wang et al.  (20) reported that patients \\nwho underwent thoracoscopic surgery had significantly \\nshorter ventilation time compared with the MS group, and \\nthat the duration of postoperative recovery until normal \\nactivity was 6 weeks after thoracoscopic surgery versus  \\n10 weeks after MS.

Although mechanical valves provide supe-rior longevity, they impose lifelong anticoagulation,which necessitates dietary restrictions, a limitation in\\nactive lifestyle, and an increased risk of bleeding and\\nthromboembolic events. Tissue valves do not requireanticoagulation and offer the bene ﬁt of being amenable\\nto transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures if they fail.The Achilles heel of tissue valves is their durability:Bovine pericardial tissue valves tend to calcify overtime, limiting their lifetime depending on patient ageand risk factors.\\n1,2With patients living longer and with\\nthe age of bioprosthetic AVR patients trending lower\\nover time because of the expanded indications of trans-catheter AVR, durability is increasingly important.\\n3\\nRESILIA tissue (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) is\\nbovine pericardial tissue incorporating a novelintegrity-preservation technology that includesstable capping of free aldehydes, preventing calciumbinding, and glycerolization, which allows it to be\\nstored dry. In a randomized study in a chronic juvenile\\nsheep model, RESILIA tissue calci ﬁed 72% less than\\ncontemporary tissue.\\n4Recently RESILIA tissue was\\ntested in a 133-patient AVR study, and the results werevery encouraging through 5 years, with stable hemo-dynamics and no events of structural valve deteriora-tion (SVD).\\n5\\nThe COMMENCE trial is an Investigational Device\\nExemption (IDE) study evaluating RESILIA tissue in a\\nlarger and broader cohort. It is particularly importantbecause it represents the primary evaluation to date ofthis tissue, which is incorporated in the commonlyimplanted INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve and KONECTRESILIA aortic valved conduit (Edwards Lifesciences).Although earlier interim analyses of the COMMENCEtrial have been reported,\\n6,7the 5-year time point repre-\\nsents a meaningful milestone by which contemporary\\nvalves begin to fail, especially in younger patients andothers at risk. Herein we report the 5-year outcomes ofthe COMMENCE trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS\\nSTUDY DESIGN AND PATIENTS. The current study was a\\nprospective, multicenter, single-arm, observational IDEstudy designed in consultation with the US Food andDrug Administration to evaluate the safety andhemodynamic performance of a bioprosthesis\\nincorporating RESILIA tissue (Clinical Trial no.\\nNCT01757665). Patients were enrolled at 27 sites in theUnited States and Poland after approval of the clinicalprotocol and enrollment form by the institutionalreview board or ethics committee at each site. Patientsaged/C2118 years and who were candidates for AVR with\\nor without concomitant procedures were included.Details regarding patient inclusion and exclusion\\ncriteria have been reported previously.\\n6Importantly\\npatients undergoing emergency AVR, with renalinsuf ﬁciency (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL or end-\\nstage renal disease on dialysis), with endocarditiswithin 3 months, undergoing repair or replacement ofanother valve, or requiring root replacement wereexcluded. All study participants provided writteninformed consent before enrollment. This report is\\nbased on a data extraction date of December 11, 2020.\\nSTUDY DEVICE AND SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The study\\ndevice consisted of the model 11000A aortic bio-prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences).

Ingeneral the outcomes were very good for this noveltissue. There were no early safety concerns, and over 5\\nyears valve hemodynamics were satisfactory and clini-\\ncally stable, with no events of SVD. Taken together withanother very similar study of 133 patients,\\n5822 patients\\nhave now received an aortic valve with this tissue withgood hemodynamics and no events of SVD over 5 yearsof follow-up. Coupled with the low prevalence of sig-niﬁcant transvalvular regurgitation, these results are\\nencouraging for the potential long-term durability of\\nRESILIA tissue.\\nThe degree of PPM at 3 months postimplant, with\\n24.8% moderate and 13.5% severe, is somewhat con-cerning and re ﬂects that we should always strive to\\nmitigate this condition. Still these data are better thanthe recently published PPM data from the contemporarysurgical AVR arm of the PARTNER 2 randomized trial.\\n14\\nStudies of contemporary tissue valves show that they\\ngenerally begin to exhibit SVD over 5 years, especially in\\nhigh-risk patient subgroups.

At3 months her mean gradient and EOA were 8 mm Hg and1.12 cm\\n2, respectively. Over 5 years the study valve\\nexhibited no transvalvular leak but progressivelyincreasing mean gradients. On postoperative day 1848\\nshe complained of signi ﬁcant fatigue, malaise, and ex-\\nertional dyspnea; echocardiogram revealed a meangradient and EOA of 23 mm Hg and 0.62 cm\\n2, respec-\\ntively. On postoperative day 1940 a valve-in-valvetranscatheter AVR was performed. The case was classi-ﬁed by the Clinical Events Committee as SVD due to\\nstudy valve calci ﬁcation.\\nOur de ﬁnition of SVD, based principally on reinter-\\nvention due to structural dysfunction, is different from\\nthat of the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 thatis used in many modern transcatheter AVR studies,\\n10\\nwhich includes hemodynamic compromise. In compari-son our conservative de ﬁnition could underestimate\\nSVD, with some patients unable to undergoreintervention.\\nThe potential implications of a more durable tissue\\nvalve are far-reaching. Recently updated guidelines for\\nthe management of valvular disease suggest it isreasonable to individualize the choice of either a me-chanical or tissue valve in patients aged 50 to 65 years.\\n21\\nGiven the patient lifestyle modi ﬁcations and restrictions\\nassociated with anticoagulation and the lack of futuretranscatheter valve-in-valve options for mechanicalvalves, the last 20 years has seen a signi ﬁcant increase inthe proportion of aortic valves that are tissue bio-\\nprostheses. A more durable tissue valve option wouldfurther tip the scales toward these bioprostheses andpotentially impact the guideline-recommended age\\ncutoffs. With a mean patient age of 67 years our study\\nincludes 248 patients <65 years of age.

Their mean age was 55.1 ± 13.8 years, and mean EuroSCORE II was 2.25% ± 1.25%. Among theenrolled patients, 32 (61.5%) patients presented with preoperative atrial ﬁbrillation, 6 (11.5%) patients had experienced embolic stroke and5 (9.6%) patients had undergone previous cardiac surgery. The operations were performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) under anarrested heart status.\\nRESULTS: Five porcine valves and 47 bovine valves were implanted. A total of 38 (73.1%) patients received concomitant cardiac proced-\\nures, including 26 Cox-maze IV procedures, 12 tricuspid valve repairs and 5 atrial septal defect repairs. The mean aortic cross-clamp andCPB times were 141.3 ± 34.3 min and 217.1 ± 42.0 min, respectively. There was no operative mortality. During the mean follow-up of29 ± 15 months, no prosthesis degeneration was noted. The average left atrial dimension exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease from51.4 ± 11.5 mm to 42.6 ± 10.1 mm.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Robotic MVR with bioprosthetic valves is safe, feasible and reproducible. Mid-term results are encouraging. Both aortic\\ncross-clamp and CPB times can be improved with experience.\\nKeywords: Robotic mitral valve replacement \\x81 Robotic cardiac surgery \\x81 Minimally invasive \\x81 Bioprosthetic valve\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMitral valve replacement (MVR) can improve survival in patients\\nwith severely irreparable mitral pathologies, such as rheumaticmitral stenosis, subvalvular ﬁbrosis with leaﬂet tethering, infec-tious leaﬂet destruction and prosthetic valve degeneration [ 1].\\nIn general, mechanical valves are recommended for younger pa-tients and bioprosthetic valves for older patients. However, alower age cut-off and the increasing use of bioprosthetic valveshave become new trends in recent decades mainly due to theimproved surgical outcomes of reoperative MVR, satisfactorylong-term durability of current-generation bioprostheses and\\nincreasing experience of transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures[2–6]. According to the guidelines of the European Society of\\nCardiology and European Association for Cardio-ThoracicSurgery in 2017, bioprosthetic valve is recommended in patientsof any age, for whom anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated,cannot be managed appropriately or is not desired [ 1].\\nRobotic MVR emerged in the late 1990s as an alternative ap-\\nproach to conventional sternotomy. When compared with theconventional sternotomy approach, minimally invasive tech-niques can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of cosmetic ap-pearance, decreased postoperative pain, lower blood transfusionrate and faster return to daily activities [ 7–12].

[12] reported excellent outcomes on robotic MVR\\nwith mechanical valves. However, limited data are available on ro-botic MVR with bioprosthetic valves due to the challenges involvedin valve implantation. With the increase in the use of bioprostheticvalves worldwide [ 2] and strong patient desire for minimally inva-\\nsive procedures [ 13], the safety and feasibility of robotic MVRs with\\nbioprosthetic valves require investigation. Thus, the aim of thisretrospective cohort study was to analyse initial experiences andmid-term clinical outcomes in our tertiary referral hospital.\\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\\nBetween January 2013 and May 2017, 200 robotic cardiac surgerieswere performed at the Chi Mei Medical Center using the da VinciSi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ofthem, 52 consecutive patients underwent robotic MVR with bio-prosthetic valves. The following patients were excluded from theanalysis: patients requiring an additional cardiac procedure on theaortic valve, aorta or coronary arteries; those previously operatedon the right chest and those with pulmonary infection. All surgicalprocedures were performed by a single console surgeon, as well asa table surgeon. Preoperative workup included transthoracic echo-cardiography and computed tomographic angiography of thechest, abdomen and pelvis. In addition, coronary angiography was\\nindicated for patients with the potential for coronary artery disease.\\nTricuspid valve repairs were perfo rmed in patients with moderate-\\nto-severe secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. The radiofre-quency Cox-maze IV procedure was performed in patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation. Left atrial appendage obliteration wasperformed in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation since July 2015. Thehospital’s institutional review board approved the study protocol.\\nSurgical technique\\nAfter the induction of general anaesthesia, patients were intu-bated smoothly as usual. A central venous catheter and a 6.5-Frintroducer sheath were placed into the right internal jugular vein.Patients were positioned in the supine position with the rightchest elevated approximately 30\\n/C14and the right arm tucked at the\\nside. External deﬁbrillator pads were placed properly. A multi-plane transoesophageal echocardiography probe was insertedbefore incision to conﬁrm the severity of the valvular heart dis-\\nease. A 2-cm oblique right groin incision was made for peripheralcannulation. After systemic heparinization, cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was established under transoesophageal echocardiog-raphy guidance. The patient’s femoral artery was cannulated forsystemic retrograde perfusion. Adjunctive distal femoral perfu-sion was achieved using an 8-Fr arterial cannula (Medtronic,Minneapolis, MN, USA). Bicaval venous drainage was initiatedthrough the right internal jugular vein and femoral vein.\\nThe da Vinci Si robotic patient cart approached the patient\\nperpendicularly from the left side. A 12-mm camera port (XcelBladeless Trocar, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) was initially\\nintroduced into the right 4th intercostal space (ICS) on the mid-\\nclavicular line. A right robot arm port (8 mm) was placed in theright 6th ICS on the anterior axillary line. A right assisted robotarm was placed in the right 5th ICS on the parasternal border. Aleft robot arm port (8 mm) was placed in the right 2nd ICS onthe midclavicular line. A 3-cm horizontal incision was fashionedin the right 4th ICS with a retractor (Tedan Surgical Innovations,Houston, TX, USA) as a working port (Fig. 1A). A transthoracic\\nChitwood cross-clamp (Scanlan International, Minneapolis, MN,USA) was placed at the right 4th ICS and midaxillary line. A cardi-oplegia venting catheter (14G BD Angiocath) was insertedthrough the right 2nd ICS on the parasternal border and directlyinto the ascending aorta. A 4-0 prolene loop was superﬁciallysutured on the proximal part of catheter. Then, it was snared by2-0 Ti-Cron sutures with Teﬂon pledgets on the ascending aorta.After aortic cross-clamping (ACC), myocardial protection wasachieved using an antegrade cold crystalloid cardioplegia of histi-dine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution (30 ml/kg; CustodiolHTK; Ko ¨hler Chemie GmbH, Bensheim, Germany).\\nStandard MVR techniques were performed. The left atrium\\nwas opened parallel to the interatrial groove. The mitral valvewas exposed using a dynamic atrial retractor. A ﬂexible drainagecatheter was placed in the left superior pulmonary vein to obtaina clear operative ﬁeld. For patients with Barlow’s deformity anddilated cardiomyopathy, bileaﬂet preservation was performed;for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, posterior mitral leaﬂetpreservation was performed; and for patients with infectiveendocarditis and prosthesis degeneration, the diseased valve wasexcised. Initially, 2-0 double-armed Ti-Cron sutures (CovidienInc., Dublin, Ireland) were anchored to the annulus with Teﬂon\\nFigure 1: External view.

Two suture guiders were estab-\\nlished to maintain the order of the stitches. The sutures werethen placed in the bioprosthesis suture ring outside the chestwall (Fig. 1B), and the bioprosthetic valves were securely im-\\nplanted into the position without debris interference in valvefunction. Under a 10-fold robotic videoscope, each stitch wasconﬁrmed and knotted using the robot arms or COR-KNOT de-vice (LSI solutions, Victor, NY, USA). The left atriotomy was closedwith 3-0 polytetraﬂuoroethylene running suture (W. L. Gore &Associates, Inc., Flagstaff, AZ, USA). The de-airing procedure wasconducted through the cardioplegia venting catheter, and theChitwood cross-clamp was released. After conﬁrming heart valveprosthesis function, the patient was weaned off CPB. Two or 310-mm closed wound vacuum drains were placed in the rightpleural cavity. The wound was closed in layers.\\nFor patients with concomitant tricuspid procedures, the right\\natrium should be opened. The superior vena cava and inferiorvena cava were snared with a yellow tape. For patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation, a radiofrequency ablation pen(Medtronic) was used to complete the left atrial or biatrial Cox-maze IV procedure, including the box lesion, left atrial append-age line and mitral isthmus line as left atrial lesions and superiorvena cava line, inferior vena cava line and right atrial free wallline as right atrial lesions. Initial energy was set at 30 J and ad-justed according to the reaction of the atrial tissue to the radio-frequency. The left atrial appendage was obliterated by a 2-0 Ti-Cron continuous suture with Teﬂon pledgets. For patientsundergoing a redo operation, an intracavitary temporary pacing\\nwire (BM604ABB, MCE, Gemert, Netherlands) was ﬁxed into the\\nleft ventricular endocardium instead of the right ventricular ad-hesive epicardium and positioned between the annulus and su-ture ring of the mitral prosthesis (Fig. 2).\\nFollow-up\\nData were obtained until September 2017. All patients were ﬁrst\\nevaluated 2 weeks after the operation. Further clinical follow-upwas conducted through biannual visits to the outpatient clinicand phone contact. Vitamin K antagonists were used as anti-coagulants in the 1st 3 months after bioprosthetic valve implant-ation, then discontinued unless patients had other indications foranticoagulation. Serial echocardiographic data were recorded toevaluate the bioprosthesis function, heart function and remodel-ling of the left atrium and left ventricle. All patients receivedechocardiography follow-up at least once in this review. In eachpatient undergoing a Cox-maze IV procedure, the 12-lead elec-\\ntrocardiogram was investigated every 3 months, and a routine24-h Holter was arranged annually or at any time when the pa-tient was symptomatic.\\nStatistical methods\\nContinuous variables are summarized as means ± standard devi-ation or medians (ranges). Categorical variables are summarized asfrequencies (percentages). The EuroSCORE II was calculated usingan online calculator. ACC and CPB times were analysed using anon-linear regression model ( r\\n2) to assess learning period effects.\\nMoreover, isolated MVRs and complicated MVRs with concomitantprocedures were analysed separately. The unpaired, 2-tailedStudent’s t-test was used to measure differences between preopera-\\ntive and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography ﬁndings.

From the majority of centres in North America, the use of mi-\\ntral bioprostheses has increased from 32% in 2000 to 63% in2007. Moreover, the patients receiving bioprosthetic valves are\\nincreasingly young. Gammie et al. [2] concluded that improved\\nsurgical outcomes in reoperative mitral valve surgery and the sat-isfactory long-term durability of current-generation bioprosthe-ses have probably contributed to this fundamental shift. Inaddition, activity constraints and complex monitoring protocolfor anticoagulation therapy and the risks of thromboembolic andbleeding events have affected the rejection of mechanical valvesby patients [ 14].\\nMinimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) includes par-\\ntial sternotomy, right anterolateral thoracotomy, right mini-thoracotomy, endoscopic-assisted mini-thoracotomy and robot-assisted surgery. MIMVS is beneﬁcial in terms of cosmetic ap-pearance, reduced postoperative pain, lower blood transfusion\\nrate, shorter length of hospital stay and faster return to daily\\nactivities [ 7–12]. There has been an increased interest in MIMVS\\nin recent decades. Using data from a nationwide surgical data-base (Japan), Nishi et al. [13] have demonstrated that the rate of\\nMIMVS has increased from 5.7% in 2008 to 15.6% in 2012. Morerecently, in a retrospective cohort of 1257 patients undergoingrobotic mitral valve surgery, Murphy et al. [10] reported a signiﬁ-\\ncant rate of acceptance of robotic mitral valve surgery: an in-crease from 46% in the 1st year of its institution to more than90% in the last 3 years. However, despite the marked growth ofMIMVS, most included in previous reports have been mitral valverepair procedures [ 7–10], whereas our series focused on valve\\nreplacement.\\nThis cohort study pertains to clinical outcomes of robotic MVR\\nwith bioprosthetic valves. Although MVR can be performed withsatisfactory outcomes using a minimally invasive endoscopictechnique [ 9], robot arms are comparably strong for extensive\\ndebridement of a severely calciﬁed annulus. In addition, biopros-thetic valves have a higher proﬁle and a wide, saddle-shaped cuffthat are considered technical challenges when implanting themthrough a small surgical wound. Using advanced robotic equip-ment, including a dynamic atrial retractor, delicate articulatedarms and a 3-dimensional high-deﬁnition videoscope, they canbe implanted properly without entrapment of stitches. Our cur-rent results compare favourably with published standards [ 7–12].\\nThere was no operative mortality, and late cardiac-related mor-tality occurred in 1 patient due to irreversible dilated cardiomy-opathy. Serial echocardiography demonstrated a signiﬁcantreduction in left atrial dimension, left ventricular end-diastolic di-mension and left ventricular end-systolic dimension.Table 3: Postoperative outcomes and complications ( n= 52)\\nProsthesis degeneration, n (%) 0 (0)\\n30-Day mortality, n(%) 0 (0)\\nLate mortality, n(%) 4 (7.7)\\nProlonged ventilation (>24 h), n(%) 7 (13.5)\\nPostoperative IABP support, n(%) 2 (3.8)\\nHigh-volume RBC transfusion (>2 U), n(%) 3 (5.8)\\nComplications, n(%)\\nRe-exploration for bleeding 1 (1.9)Sternotomy conversion 1 (1.9)\\nMyocardial infarction 0 (0)\\nStroke 1 (1.9)Reversible neurological injury 2 (3.8)Unilateral pulmonary oedema 4 (7.7)\\nLow cardiac output 1 (1.9)\\nPhrenic nerve palsy 0 (0)Wound infection 0 (0)Limb ischaemia 0 (0)\\nAortic dissection 0 (0)\\nPermanent pacemaker implantation 1 (1.9)New haemodialysis 0 (0)New onset atrial ﬁbrillation 2 (3.8)\\nIABP: intra-aortic balloon pumping; RBC: red blood cell.Table 4: Echocardiographic data ( n= 52)\\nVariables Preoperative,\\nmean ± SDPostoperative,\\nmean ± SDP-value\\nLVEF (%) 65.5 ± 10.8 66.4 ± 10.4 0.61\\nLA dimension (mm) 51.4 ± 11.5 42.6 ± 10.1 <0.01\\nLVESD (mm) 32.8 ± 8.3 29.8 ± 7.1 <0.01\\nLVEDD (mm) 52.1 ± 10.5 47.2 ± 8.7 <0.01RVSP (mmHg) 37.2 ± 19.3 31.8 ± 15.8 0.10Mean TPG (mmHg) 3.64 ± 3\\nLA: left atrium; LVEDD: left ventricular end-diastolic dimension; LVEF: left\\nventricular ejection fraction; LVESD: left ventricular end-systolic dimension;\\nRVSP: right ventricular systolic pressure; SD: standard deviation; TPG: trans-\\nprosthetic pressure gradient.\\nCONVENTIONAL\\nVALVE OPERATIONS5 C.-C.

Few centres in Asia launched the robotic programmedue to concerns about its safety, complexity and costs [ 15]. Some\\nreports have also claimed an increased incidence of stroke be-cause of the use of retrograde perfusion by femoral arterialcannulation [ 16]. In our protocol, cerebral oximeter (INVOS,\\nMedtronic) was used during MIMVS, and no patient experiencedintraoperative stroke. Although 1 patient did experience stroke,this was due to low cardiac output syndrome in the postopera-tive recovery period; 2 other patients had reversible neurologicalinjury during mid-term follow-up. This report revealed that 4 pa-tients experienced right unilateral pulmonary oedema, and noneof them required postoperative extracorporeal life support.Unilateral pulmonary oedema is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication after MIMVS through the right side ofchest. The mechanism is thought to be associated with theischaemia–reperfusion injury to the lung, as well as the general-ized inﬂammatory response, leading to higher vascular perme-ability with subsequent pulmonary oedema [ 17–19]. Moss et al.\\n[19] have made some modiﬁcations to reduce the incidence, and\\nwe have made similar efforts in our projects. Unilateral pulmon-ary oedema eliminated within the preceding 2 years may beattributed to the following intraoperative strategies: maintainingadequate arterial inﬂow, shortening CPB time and implementingpulmonary recruitment manoeuvres.\\nIn our series, mean ACC and CPB times were slightly extended,\\nwhich was mainly attributed to the 73.1% of patients who under-went concomitant procedures. In addition, extensive decalciﬁca-tion in rheumatic mitral stenosis is another reason for theprolonged operative time. Despite the longer operative time, werevealed an improvement after overcoming the learning curve\\nand understanding the applications of new devices. Both ACC\\nand CPB times improved remarkably with experience (Fig. 3). In\\nthe last 10 cases, the COR-KNOT device was used for mitral pros-thesis ﬁxation, signiﬁcantly reducing the knotting time from 30to 6 min.\\nThe development of MIMVS has greatly inﬂuenced the surgical\\ntechniques and clinical outcomes of reoperative cardiac surgery.Minimally invasive approaches can lower the risk of damage tocardiac structure. Series reports have presented favourable re-sults, with 30-day mortality rates of approximately 3–5% [ 20–22].\\nSince our programme was initiated in 2013, we have performed7 reoperative robotic MVRs, including 5 patients under aortic-clamping arrested heart status (this study) and 2 patients undernon-clamping ﬁbrillating heart condition. Average intraoperativeblood loss was 300 ml. All patients resumed their daily taskswithin a week after the operation. An intracavitary temporarypacing wire was placed into the left ventricular endocardium,which is a standard procedure in our reoperative robotic MVR(Fig. 2). This technique was initially described by Casselman et al.\\n[22] in their endoscopic redo mitral and tricuspid valve surgery.\\nHowever, slightly different from the ordinary method, welaunched an innovative concept to place the intracavitary pacingwire between the mitral annulus and prosthetic suture ring. Thus,the pacing wire does not compromise the leaﬂet coaptation ordamage the prosthesis. In this study, all intracavitary pacing wirefunctioned well, and they were removed 1 week postoperativelywithout thromboembolic or bleeding events.\\nAnother important ﬁnding of this study is the high rate of con-\\ncomitant Cox-maze IV procedure performed. Atrial ﬁbrillationrates vary between 30% and 50% among patients undergoingmitral valve surgery, which can increase the risk of stroke and re-\\nduce survival. In a randomized control trial, Gillinov et al. [23]\\ndemonstrated that patients undergoing the surgical ablation inaddition to mitral valve surgery had signiﬁcantly increased ratesof freedom from atrial ﬁbrillation. As with minimally invasivetechniques for mitral valve surgery, an increasing trend of interestwas noted for the maze procedure. Nifong et al. [24] conducted\\nthe 1st and largest study to date evaluating the clinical outcomesfollowing robotic mitral valve repair concomitant with the mazeprocedure; 96.5% of patients reported freedom from atrial ﬁbril-lation without taking antiarrhythmic drugs or warfarin. In ourstudy, sinus rhythm was restored in nearly 90% of patients. Mostcan discontinue warfarin or downgrade to antiplatelet therapyafter the blanking period. In patients with mitral valve diseaseand atrial ﬁbrillation, our limited experience provides a new per-spective for bioprosthesis implantation in combination with ag-gressive restoration of sinus rhythm.\\nLimitations\\nThis study has the inherent limitations of a retrospective observa-tional data collected from a relatively small population in a singlecentre. Given that this is not a randomized study, surgeon biascannot be ignored. Prior to valve replacement, valve repair was at-tempted. Therefore, only patients with irreparable mitral valve dis-ease underwent valve replacement surgery, which limited thenumber of cases studied. All patients received at least once echo-cardiography follow-up after the operation. However, the pre-operative echocardiography and postoperative echocardiographywere not performed by a single cardiologist. Finally, there was nocontrol group to compare our study group within this series, be-cause, since 2013, most patients have undergone robotic cardiacsurgery instead of conventional sternotomy in our institution.Thus, a well-designed study is required to validate the advantagesof robotic MVR.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn conclusion, robotic MVR with bioprosthetic valves is safe, feas-ible and reproducible with encouraging clinical outcomes. BothACC and CPB times can improve remarkably with experience.Although the preliminary data suggest acceptable echocardio-graphic results, a long-term follow-up remains necessary to under-stand the beneﬁts of robotic MVR with bioprosthetic valves.\\nConﬂict of interest: none declared.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Rofﬁ M, Alﬁeri O, Agewall S, Ahlsson A, Barbato E, Bueno H et al . 2017\\nESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease.

The best 202 matches from the \\nMI group and the MS group were analyzed. The clinical data of the two groups were collected, including \\npreoperative cardiac function, operative data, postoperative complications, and follow-up.\\nResults:  A final total of 404 patients were included in this study after propensity score matching; the \\nMIs group and the MS group each contained 202 patients. The two groups were similar in age, weight, \\npathological changes, and surgical approach. Compared with the MS group, the MIs group had a longer \\ncardiopulmonary bypass time (P<0.001), aortic cross-clamping time (P<0.001), and total procedure time \\n(P<0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding in-hospital mortality, stroke, \\npneumonia, acute renal failure, arrhythmia, and chylothorax. The MS group had significantly more patients \\nwith poor wound healing than the MIs group (P=0.004). The MI group had a lower rate of transfusion \\n(P=0.037), shorter ventilation time (P=0.041), shorter ICU stay (P=0.033), reduced chest tube drainage \\nand length of chest tube stay (P<0.001), and shorter hospital stay (P<0.001). There was no significant \\ndifference between the groups in hospital re-admission for bleeding, but the total hospitalization cost was \\nhigher in the MIs group (P=0.002). The mean follow-up was 26.59±12.33 months, the 1-year postoperative \\nsurvival rate was 98.86%, and the overall survival rate was 97.44%. Compared with the MS group, the MIs \\ngroup recovered earlier (P<0.05), and returned to work or study earlier (P<0.05). More patients in the MIs \\ngroup were satisfied with the wound (P<0.001). The MS group had a higher incidence of postoperative \\nosteomyelitis than the MIs group (P=0.028). There were no significant differences between groups in rates \\nof mortality, stroke, pacemaker, reoperation, or 36-item Short Form Health Survey score.\\nConclusions:  Compared with the MS approach, the MIs method of mitral valve replacement has longer \\ncardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time; however, it does not increase the risk of mortality 341', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In order \\nto improve postoperative outcomes, minimally invasive \\napproaches including via an upper and lower incision on \\nthe sternum and via left and right anterolateral incisions \\nhave been performed (2,3). Compared to conventional MS, \\nthese minimally invasive approaches reduce trauma to the \\nsternum but still require exposure of the ascending aorta \\nand the superior and inferior vena cava (IVC) to establish \\nthe central cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which limits \\nfurther minimization of invasiveness in cardiac surgery.\\nWith the innovation of the port access approach in the \\nlate 1990s, the success of the first thoracoscopic-assisted \\nminimally invasive mitral valve (MV) surgery via a small \\nright anterolateral incision had shown that minimally \\ninvasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery with peripheral CPB \\nwas as feasible, safe, and effective as the conventional MS \\napproach (2,4-8). However, performing a thoracoscopic \\ncardiac surgery usually meant the surgeon was limited to a \\nvery narrow surgical field with poor exposure and required \\nthe use of long-shafted endoscopic instruments, which \\nmarkedly increased the learning difficulty and learning \\ncurve (9,10). Furthermore, early research showed that the \\nCPB time and aortic cross-clamping time in minimally \\ninvasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery was significantly \\nlonger than that in MS, and the risk of stroke was higher in \\nthe minimally invasive group (11-13).\\nIn this study, propensity score matching (PSM) was used \\nto enable proper comparative retrospective analysis of the \\ndata from patients who underwent MV replacement (MVR) \\nsurgery via minimally invasive thoracoscopy versus those \\nwho underwent traditional MS, to determine and compare \\nthe short-term mortality and long-term post cardiac surgery outcomes of these two approaches. This study was aimed \\nto evaluate the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopic cardiac \\nsurgery and provide guidance for surgeons who intend to \\nperform thoracoscopic cardiac surgery in China.\\nMethods\\nPatients\\nFrom January 1st, 2012 to June 30th, 2015, a total of 1,096 \\npatients who underwent MVR surgery concomitant \\nwith tricuspid valve surgery or atrial fibrillation ablation \\ntherapy in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery \\nof Guangdong Cardiovascular Institute were analyzed. \\nPatients undergoing other concomitant procedures such as \\naortic surgery, aortic valve replacement, or coronary artery \\nbypass graft were excluded. Patients who were younger than \\n18 years old, or undergoing a second MVR or conversion \\nto MVR from a mitral valvuloplasty procedure were also \\nexcluded. Emergency surgery cases were also excluded from \\nthis study. Of the 1,096 patients, 405 were operated on with \\na minimally invasive surgery of the MVR (MIs-MVR), and \\n691 cases were operated on with MS-MVR.\\nThe primary outcome was a composite end point \\nconsisting of all important adverse events, including 30-day \\nmortality, stroke, aortic dissection, perioperative myocardial \\ninfarction, new atrial fibrillation, intraoperative conversion \\nto sternotomy, re-exploration for bleeding, and low-cardiac-\\noutput syndrome with necessity for intra-aortic balloon \\npump. Follow-up vital status was obtained by telephone or \\nroutine clinic visit. The 36-item Short Form Health Survey \\nwas used for the last follow-up.\\nSurgical technique\\nMinimally invasive thoracoscopic MVR surgery \\nCPB was instituted via femoral arterial and venous and complications. Furthermore, MIs causes less trauma, fewer transfusions, less wound infection, faster \\nrecovery, faster return to work or study, and greater satisfaction with the incision in the mid-term. MI cardiac \\nsurgery is safe, effective, and feasible.\\nKeywords:  Minimally invasive; totally thoracoscopic; median sternotomy (MS); mitral valve replacement (MVR); \\npropensity score matching (PSM)\\nSubmitted May 31, 2019.

Retrograde perfusion was performed through \\nthe right femoral artery (18–24 Fr). The tip of the venous \\ncannula was positioned in the IVC (22–28 Fr), and then a \\nsecond venous cannula was inserted percutaneously through \\nthe right internal jugular vein and positioned in the superior \\nvena cava (SVC) (16–18 Fr). Patient temperature was cooled \\nto 34 ℃, and vacuum-assisted CPB was used throughout the \\nprocedure. \\nThe surgical approach was performed via two ports in \\nthe right chest ( Figure 1 ).\\nMain port\\nA right lateral mini-thoracotomy, about 3.5–4.0 cm in \\nlength, was performed in the 4th intercostal space; the \\nspecific size should be sufficient for the artificial valve to be \\npassed through. For male patients, the incision was placed \\njust below and lateral to the nipple, and for female patients, \\nthe incision was placed in the sub-mammary crease. A small \\ntissue retractor was utilized to protect the incision.\\nThoracoscopic port\\nA video camera was inserted through a 10-mm port in \\nthe 4th intercostal space in the proximal midaxillary line. \\nA transthoracic Chitwood aortic cross-clamp and a left \\nventricular (L V) vent were also inserted through this port. \\nAntegrade crystalloid Bretschneider cardioplegia (2:l) \\nwas administered directly into the aortic root, and then \\ncontinued for 90–120 min if necessary. The surgical field \\nwas flooded with CO2 through the camera port throughout \\nthe procedure. The pleura should be opened after the \\npatient is placed on CPB. The left atrium was opened \\nposterior to the interatrial groove. A left atrial retractor \\nwas used to expose the MV . Specialized long-shafted surgical tools were utilized for tissue handling and suturing. \\nStandard MV replacement was performed under totally \\nendoscopic vision. Concomitant tricuspid valvuloplasty \\ncould be performed by blocking the SVC and the L V \\ncompliance (L VC) through the right atrium. Deairing \\nwas performed via a left ventricle drainage tube and the \\ncardioplegia puncture site on the ascending aorta.\\nIntraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was \\nused to determine the immediate results of the replacement \\nand check for perivalvular leakage and residual bubble. \\nIf the outcome was satisfactory and there was no active \\nbleeding at the incisions, the pericardium was closed with \\ninterrupted sutures, and the incisions were sutured using \\nthe thoracoscope. CPB should be stopped after the central \\ntemperature returns to normal.

The PSM was \\nperformed by matching patients in the two groups at a \\n1:1 ratio, without replacement, by the nearest neighbor \\ntechnique. PSM was performed with age, sex, L V ejection \\nfraction (L VEF), pulmonary artery pressure, Euroscore \\nII value, type of lesion, and surgical technique as the \\nobservation indicators, and using SPSS 21.0 software (IBM, \\nArmonk, NY, USA). This resulted in 404 matched cases: \\n202 in the MIs group, and 202 in the MS group. The \\ncriterion for matching pairs used a caliper width equal to \\n0.2 of the pooled SD of the logit of propensity score. After \\nmatching, there was no significant difference between the \\ntwo groups in New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac \\nfunction classification, valvular lesion type, or surgical \\ntechnique (all P>0.05, T able 1 ).\\nNormal distributed continuous variables are expressed \\nas the mean ± standard deviation, and categorical variables \\nas proportions throughout this study. Continuous variables \\nwere analyzed using the Student’s t-test or the Mann-\\nWhitney U test of two independent samples. Categorical \\nvariables were analyzed using the χ2 test. Survival curves \\nwere analyzed with Kaplan-Meier actuarial methods, \\nand log-rank was used to detect the differences between \\ngroups. All tests were two-tailed, and P values <0.05 \\nwere considered significant. SPSS 21.0 software was used \\nfor the statistical analyses, and the follow-up data were \\nrecorded using EpiData software (Version 3.1, Odense,  \\nDenmark, 2004). \\nResults\\nMVR surgery was successfully completed in the two \\nmatched groups of patients, with no cases of surgical \\nfailure. There was no intraoperative conversion to median \\nthoracotomy surgery in the MIs group. Compared with \\nthe MS group, the MIs group had significantly longer \\nCPB time, aortic cross-clamping time, and operation \\ntime (P<0.001), but a significantly lower intraoperative \\ntransfusion rate and fewer transfusion units (both P<0.05, \\nT able 2 ).\\nThe early postoperative data showed that the MS group, \\nwhen compared with the MIs group, had a significantly \\nlonger length of ventilation and ICU stay, significantly increased chest tube drainage, significantly increased \\npostoperative transfusion rate and volume, significantly \\nlonger duration of chest tube drainage and postoperative \\nhospital stay, and significantly increased total hospitalization \\ncost (all P <0.05, T able 3 ). However, there was no significant \\ndifference between groups in the need for re-exploration for \\nbleeding and postoperative L VEF . There was no significant \\ndifference between the two groups in the morbidity rate of \\nin-hospital death, stroke, pulmonary infection, arrhythmia, \\nacute renal failure, or chylothorax, but the MS group had \\na significantly increased incision infection rate (P =0.004), \\nand a significantly higher morbidity rate of all the early \\npostoperative complications (P =0.038, T ables 3,4 ).\\nIn this study, 8 patients died during early postoperative \\nhospitalization (3 in the MIs group and 5 in the MS group). \\nCause of death in the MIs group was stroke, lung infection, \\nand disseminated intravascular coagulation (n=2); and \\npulmonary infection and malignant arrhythmia (n=1). In the \\nMS group, cause of death was stroke, pulmonary infection \\nand multiple organ failure (n=2); low cardiac output \\nsyndrome and malignant cardiac arrhythmia (n=1); and \\npulmonary infection and renal failure (n=2).\\nT elephone or outpatient follow-up was conducted for \\na total of 396 patients (199 in the MIs group, and 197 in \\nthe MS group) who were discharged from the hospital  \\n6–48 months postoperatively, with an average follow-\\nup period of 26.59±12.33 months. There was a total of \\n361 valid follow-ups, with 35 patients being unable to be \\nfollowed up due to change of contact information (16 in the \\nMIs group and 19 in the MS group); the withdrawal rate \\nwas 8.84%.\\nNine patients (2.27%) died during follow-up. In the MIs \\ngroup, 2 patients died of stroke and pulmonary infection, \\n1 died of malignant cardiac arrhythmia, and 1 died of \\nunknown causes. In the MS group, 2 patients died from \\nstroke, 2 died from renal failure and pulmonary infection, \\nand there was 1 case of sudden death for unknown reasons. \\nA comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( Figure 2 ) \\nand log-rank testing showed no significant difference in \\nsurvival between the two groups (P =0.836). There was no \\nsignificant difference between the two groups in the rate of \\nreoperation, the need to install a permanent pacemaker, or \\nthe incidence of stroke ( T able 5 ).

Moreover, the morbidity of all \\npostoperative complications was significantly lower in the \\nMIs group compared to the MS group.\\nMinimally invasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery may potentially have benefits over traditional thoracotomy. \\nThoracoscopic cardiac surgery is conducted through a \\nsmall incision on the right chest, which does not damage \\nthe median sternum and thus greatly reduces the degree of \\nsurgical trauma compared with conventional sternotomy. \\nThe intercostal port and tissue retractor markedly reduce \\nthe damage and pain caused to the surrounding muscle \\ntissues (20). The applications of a high-resolution graphic \\nsystem and 10 mm camera lens enable a more precise and \\nclearer surgical vision, which provides better observation of \\nintraoperative bleeding and allows more accurate operation. \\nTherefore, it reduces transfusion rate and transfusion-\\nrelated complications, postoperative chest tube drainage, \\nand length of chest tube drainage stay (18,19). In this study, \\nthe MIs group had significantly less chest tube drainage, \\nshorter stay of chest tube drainage, a lower rate of intra- \\nand postoperative transfusion, and a lower transfusion \\nvolume than the MS group.\\nMinimally invasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery \\nimproves early postoperative recovery compared with MS. \\nThoracoscopic cardiac surgery maintains the integrity and \\nstability of the thorax and decreases the early postoperative \\nincision pain compared with the MS approach. Minimally \\ninvasive thoracoscopic cardiac surgery is also conducive \\nto early postoperative respiratory function recovery and \\nshortens the ventilation time and ICU stay. In addition, \\nearlier postoperative off-bed activity is conducive to \\ngastrointestinal motility and reduces the incidence of \\npostoperative complications related to long-term rest in \\nbed (12,19,20). Wang et al.  (20) reported that patients \\nwho underwent thoracoscopic surgery had significantly \\nshorter ventilation time compared with the MS group, and \\nthat the duration of postoperative recovery until normal \\nactivity was 6 weeks after thoracoscopic surgery versus  \\n10 weeks after MS.

Although mechanical valves provide supe-rior longevity, they impose lifelong anticoagulation,which necessitates dietary restrictions, a limitation in\\nactive lifestyle, and an increased risk of bleeding and\\nthromboembolic events. Tissue valves do not requireanticoagulation and offer the bene ﬁt of being amenable\\nto transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures if they fail.The Achilles heel of tissue valves is their durability:Bovine pericardial tissue valves tend to calcify overtime, limiting their lifetime depending on patient ageand risk factors.\\n1,2With patients living longer and with\\nthe age of bioprosthetic AVR patients trending lower\\nover time because of the expanded indications of trans-catheter AVR, durability is increasingly important.\\n3\\nRESILIA tissue (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) is\\nbovine pericardial tissue incorporating a novelintegrity-preservation technology that includesstable capping of free aldehydes, preventing calciumbinding, and glycerolization, which allows it to be\\nstored dry. In a randomized study in a chronic juvenile\\nsheep model, RESILIA tissue calci ﬁed 72% less than\\ncontemporary tissue.\\n4Recently RESILIA tissue was\\ntested in a 133-patient AVR study, and the results werevery encouraging through 5 years, with stable hemo-dynamics and no events of structural valve deteriora-tion (SVD).\\n5\\nThe COMMENCE trial is an Investigational Device\\nExemption (IDE) study evaluating RESILIA tissue in a\\nlarger and broader cohort. It is particularly importantbecause it represents the primary evaluation to date ofthis tissue, which is incorporated in the commonlyimplanted INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve and KONECTRESILIA aortic valved conduit (Edwards Lifesciences).Although earlier interim analyses of the COMMENCEtrial have been reported,\\n6,7the 5-year time point repre-\\nsents a meaningful milestone by which contemporary\\nvalves begin to fail, especially in younger patients andothers at risk. Herein we report the 5-year outcomes ofthe COMMENCE trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS\\nSTUDY DESIGN AND PATIENTS. The current study was a\\nprospective, multicenter, single-arm, observational IDEstudy designed in consultation with the US Food andDrug Administration to evaluate the safety andhemodynamic performance of a bioprosthesis\\nincorporating RESILIA tissue (Clinical Trial no.\\nNCT01757665). Patients were enrolled at 27 sites in theUnited States and Poland after approval of the clinicalprotocol and enrollment form by the institutionalreview board or ethics committee at each site. Patientsaged/C2118 years and who were candidates for AVR with\\nor without concomitant procedures were included.Details regarding patient inclusion and exclusion\\ncriteria have been reported previously.\\n6Importantly\\npatients undergoing emergency AVR, with renalinsuf ﬁciency (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL or end-\\nstage renal disease on dialysis), with endocarditiswithin 3 months, undergoing repair or replacement ofanother valve, or requiring root replacement wereexcluded. All study participants provided writteninformed consent before enrollment. This report is\\nbased on a data extraction date of December 11, 2020.\\nSTUDY DEVICE AND SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The study\\ndevice consisted of the model 11000A aortic bio-prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences). This trilea ﬂet bio-\\nprosthesis is the same as the Carpentier-EdwardsPERIMOUNT Magna Ease aortic valve (model 3300TFX;\\nEdwards Lifesciences) except it includes RESILIA tissue\\nleaﬂets.\\nSurgical approach and implantation technique were\\nleft to the discretion of the surgeon and included fullsternotomy, mini upper sternotomy, and right anteriorthoracotomy approach. All patients implanted with thestudy valve were maintained on antiplatelet therapy(except if contraindicated) based on the acting American\\nCollege of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2006\\nguidelines for the management of patients with valvularheart disease\\n8. However the ﬁnal decision to start and\\nstop antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy was at thediscretion of the surgeon.2 BAVARIA ET AL\\nFIVE-YEAR COMMENCE TRIAL AVR OUTCOMESAnn Thorac Surg\\n2022;-:---\\nDownloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Northeastern University from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on April 06, \\n2022.

Of 694 patients enrolled between January\\n2013 and March 2016, 689 were successfully implantedwith the study valve and are the subject of this report.The average patient age at implant was 66.9 /C611.6 years,\\nwith 53 patients (7.7%) <50 years, 91 (13.2%) aged 50 to\\n59 years, and 104 (15.1%) aged 60 to 64 years. AverageSociety of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortalityscore was 2.0% /C61.8%. Among the patients at baseline\\n24% were NYHA class I, 50% class II, 24% class III, and2% class IV. Although the incidence of various cardio-\\nvascular comorbidities has been reported previously,\\n6\\nthe incidence of noncardiovascular comorbidities wassmoking (previous or current) in 48.8%, obesity in45.0%, diabetes in 28.4%, cancer in 23.2%, musculo-skeletal dysfunction in 16.8%, chronic obstructive pul-\\nmonary disease in 14.2%, renal failure/insuf ﬁciency in\\n8.6%, immunosuppression in 5.4%, and liver disease in2.6%.\\nThe surgical approach undertaken in these patients\\nwas full sternotomy in 82.4%, mini upper sternotomy in15.4%, and right anterior thoracotomy in 2.2%; 59.1% ofpatients underwent isolated AVR.\\n6Study valve size was\\n23.8/C62.3 mm, with 22% of valves 19 or 21 mm. Fifteen\\npatients (2.2%) underwent aortic root enlargements.\\nAntiplatelet agent use at baseline was 61.4% (423/689),at discharge was 91.3% (623/682), and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5years was 84.5% (544/644), 83.3% (507/609), 82.5% (475/576), 80.3% (423/527), and 79.1% (368/465), respectively.Anticoagulant use at these time points was 9.7% (67/689), 31.8% (217/682), 13.4% (86/644), 13.6% (83/609),13.9% (80/576), 14.8% (78/527), and 17.8% (83/465),\\nrespectively.\\nCLINICAL OUTCOMES.

Ingeneral the outcomes were very good for this noveltissue. There were no early safety concerns, and over 5\\nyears valve hemodynamics were satisfactory and clini-\\ncally stable, with no events of SVD. Taken together withanother very similar study of 133 patients,\\n5822 patients\\nhave now received an aortic valve with this tissue withgood hemodynamics and no events of SVD over 5 yearsof follow-up. Coupled with the low prevalence of sig-niﬁcant transvalvular regurgitation, these results are\\nencouraging for the potential long-term durability of\\nRESILIA tissue.\\nThe degree of PPM at 3 months postimplant, with\\n24.8% moderate and 13.5% severe, is somewhat con-cerning and re ﬂects that we should always strive to\\nmitigate this condition. Still these data are better thanthe recently published PPM data from the contemporarysurgical AVR arm of the PARTNER 2 randomized trial.\\n14\\nStudies of contemporary tissue valves show that they\\ngenerally begin to exhibit SVD over 5 years, especially in\\nhigh-risk patient subgroups. In a large propensity-matched comparison Yongue and colleagues\\n15recently\\nreported freedom from reoperation due to SVD at 5 yearsof 95.9% for the Trifecta bioprosthesis vs 98.7% for theCarpentier-Edwards Perimount valve (mean patient age,69 years).

Finally a recent single-center analysis of over\\n1000 PERIMOUNT Magna Ease patients reports a reop-\\neration due to SVD rate of 0.3% over 5 /C62 years (mean\\npatient age, 67 years).\\n20Taken in their totality our re-\\nsults of 0 SVD events through 5 years (or including the 1SVD event after 5 years) in 689 patients are encouraging,particularly given the methodologic rigor of this IDEstudy and the mean cohort age of 67 years. Still howeverthe incidence of calci ﬁc SVD remains rare at 5 years, and\\nlonger follow-up is needed to evaluate the durability of\\nRESILIA tissue.\\nThe 1 SVD event observed, just beyond 5 years, was\\nfrom a 67-year-old woman with hypertension andhyperlipidemia implanted with a 21-mm study valve. At3 months her mean gradient and EOA were 8 mm Hg and1.12 cm\\n2, respectively. Over 5 years the study valve\\nexhibited no transvalvular leak but progressivelyincreasing mean gradients. On postoperative day 1848\\nshe complained of signi ﬁcant fatigue, malaise, and ex-\\nertional dyspnea; echocardiogram revealed a meangradient and EOA of 23 mm Hg and 0.62 cm\\n2, respec-\\ntively. On postoperative day 1940 a valve-in-valvetranscatheter AVR was performed. The case was classi-ﬁed by the Clinical Events Committee as SVD due to\\nstudy valve calci ﬁcation.\\nOur de ﬁnition of SVD, based principally on reinter-\\nvention due to structural dysfunction, is different from\\nthat of the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 thatis used in many modern transcatheter AVR studies,\\n10\\nwhich includes hemodynamic compromise. In compari-son our conservative de ﬁnition could underestimate\\nSVD, with some patients unable to undergoreintervention.\\nThe potential implications of a more durable tissue\\nvalve are far-reaching. Recently updated guidelines for\\nthe management of valvular disease suggest it isreasonable to individualize the choice of either a me-chanical or tissue valve in patients aged 50 to 65 years.\\n21\\nGiven the patient lifestyle modi ﬁcations and restrictions\\nassociated with anticoagulation and the lack of futuretranscatheter valve-in-valve options for mechanicalvalves, the last 20 years has seen a signi ﬁcant increase inthe proportion of aortic valves that are tissue bio-\\nprostheses. A more durable tissue valve option wouldfurther tip the scales toward these bioprostheses andpotentially impact the guideline-recommended age\\ncutoffs. With a mean patient age of 67 years our study\\nincludes 248 patients <65 years of age.

      "Between January 2013 and May 2017, 200 robotic cardiac surgerieswere performed at the Chi Mei Medical Center using the da VinciSi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Ofthem, 52 consecutive patients underwent robotic MVR with bio-prosthetic valves. The following patients were excluded from theanalysis: patients requiring an additional cardiac procedure on theaortic valve, aorta or coronary arteries; those previously operatedon the right chest and those with pulmonary infection. All surgicalprocedures were performed by a single console surgeon, as well asa table surgeon. Preoperative workup included transthoracic echo-cardiography and computed tomographic angiography of thechest, abdomen and pelvis. In addition, coronary angiography was\n",
      "indicated for patients with the potential for coronary artery disease.\n",
      "Tricuspid valve repairs were perfo rmed in patients with moderate-\n",
      "to-severe secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation. The radiofre-quency Cox-maze IV procedure was performed in patients withpersistent atrial ﬁbrillation. Left atrial appendage obliteration wasperformed in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation since July 2015. Thehospital’s institutional review board approved the study protocol.\n",

However, alower age cut-off and the increasing use of bioprosthetic valveshave become new trends in recent decades mainly due to theimproved surgical outcomes of reoperative MVR, satisfactorylong-term durability of current-generation bioprostheses and\\nincreasing experience of transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures[2–6]. According to the guidelines of the European Society of\\nCardiology and European Association for Cardio-ThoracicSurgery in 2017, bioprosthetic valve is recommended in patientsof any age, for whom anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated,cannot be managed appropriately or is not desired [ 1].\\nRobotic MVR emerged in the late 1990s as an alternative ap-\\nproach to conventional sternotomy. When compared with theconventional sternotomy approach, minimally invasive tech-niques can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of cosmetic ap-pearance, decreased postoperative pain, lower blood transfusionrate and faster return to daily activities [ 7–12].

From the majority of centres in North America, the use of mi-\\ntral bioprostheses has increased from 32% in 2000 to 63% in2007. Moreover, the patients receiving bioprosthetic valves are\\nincreasingly young. Gammie et al. [2] concluded that improved\\nsurgical outcomes in reoperative mitral valve surgery and the sat-isfactory long-term durability of current-generation bioprosthe-ses have probably contributed to this fundamental shift. Inaddition, activity constraints and complex monitoring protocolfor anticoagulation therapy and the risks of thromboembolic andbleeding events have affected the rejection of mechanical valvesby patients [ 14].\\nMinimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS) includes par-\\ntial sternotomy, right anterolateral thoracotomy, right mini-thoracotomy, endoscopic-assisted mini-thoracotomy and robot-assisted surgery. MIMVS is beneﬁcial in terms of cosmetic ap-pearance, reduced postoperative pain, lower blood transfusion\\nrate, shorter length of hospital stay and faster return to daily\\nactivities [ 7–12]. There has been an increased interest in MIMVS\\nin recent decades. Using data from a nationwide surgical data-base (Japan), Nishi et al. [13] have demonstrated that the rate of\\nMIMVS has increased from 5.7% in 2008 to 15.6% in 2012.

[10] reported a signiﬁ-\\ncant rate of acceptance of robotic mitral valve surgery: an in-crease from 46% in the 1st year of its institution to more than90% in the last 3 years. However, despite the marked growth ofMIMVS, most included in previous reports have been mitral valverepair procedures [ 7–10], whereas our series focused on valve\\nreplacement.\\nThis cohort study pertains to clinical outcomes of robotic MVR\\nwith bioprosthetic valves. Although MVR can be performed withsatisfactory outcomes using a minimally invasive endoscopictechnique [ 9], robot arms are comparably strong for extensive\\ndebridement of a severely calciﬁed annulus. In addition, biopros-thetic valves have a higher proﬁle and a wide, saddle-shaped cuffthat are considered technical challenges when implanting themthrough a small surgical wound. Using advanced robotic equip-ment, including a dynamic atrial retractor, delicate articulatedarms and a 3-dimensional high-deﬁnition videoscope, they canbe implanted properly without entrapment of stitches. Our cur-rent results compare favourably with published standards [ 7–12].\\nThere was no operative mortality, and late cardiac-related mor-tality occurred in 1 patient due to irreversible dilated cardiomy-opathy.
